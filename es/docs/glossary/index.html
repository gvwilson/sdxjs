<dd>To find a function or a property of an <a href="#object">object</a> by name while a program is running. For example, instead of getting a specific property of an object using <code>obj.name</code>, a program might use <code>obj[someVariable]</code>, where <code>someVariable</code> could hold <code>"name"</code> or some other property name.</dd>
<dt><span class="gl-key" id="dynamic_scoping">dynamic scoping</span></dt>
<dd>To find the value of a variable by looking at what is on the <a href="#call_stack">call stack</a> at the moment the lookup is done. Almost all programming languages use <a href="#lexical_scoping">lexical-scoping</a> instead, since it is more predictable.</dd>
