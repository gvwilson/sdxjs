<p>The best way to learn design is to study examples <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Schon1984">Schon1984</a>, <a class="bibref" href="#Petre2016">Petre2016</a></span>,
and some of the best examples of software design come from
the tools programmers use in their own work.
In these lessons we build small versions of things like file backup systems,
testing frameworks,
regular expression matchers,
and browser layout engines
both to demystify them
and to give some insights into how experienced programmers think.
We draw inspiration from <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Brown2011">Brown2011</a>, <a class="bibref" href="#Brown2012">Brown2012</a>, <a class="bibref" href="#Brown2016">Brown2016</a></span>,

<h2 id="introduction-audience">Section 1.1:  Who is our audience?</h2>
<p>Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.
These three <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas">personas</a> describe ours:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aïsha started writing VB macros for Excel in an accounting course and never looked back.
    After spending three years doing front-end JavaScript work
    she now wants to learn how to build back-end applications.
    This material will fill in some gaps in her programming knowledge
    and teach her some common design patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rupinder is studying computer science at college.
    He has learned a lot about the theory of algorithms,
    and while he uses Git and unit testing tools in his assignments,
    he doesn't feel he understands how they work.
    This material will give him a better understanding of those tools
    and of how to design new ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yim builds mobile apps for a living
    but also teaches two college courses:
    one on full-stack web development using JavaScript and Node
    and another titled "Software Design".
    They are happy with the former,
    but frustrated that so many books about the latter subject talk about it in the abstract
    and use examples that their students can't relate to.
    This material will fill those gaps
    and give them starting points for a wide variety of course assignments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like these three personas, readers should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write JavaScript programs using loops, arrays, functions, and classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create static web pages using HTML and CSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Node on their computer
    and run programs with it from the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to save and share files.
    (It's OK not to know <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">the more obscure commands</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain what a tree is and how to process one recursively.
    (This is the most complicated data structure and algorithm we <em>don't</em> explain.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This book can be read on its own or used as a classroom resource.
If you are looking for a project to do in a software design course,
adding a tool to those covered here would be fun as well as educational.
Please see <a class="crossref" href="#conclusion">Chapter 21</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-contents">Section 1.2:  What tools and ideas do we cover?</h2>
<p>Programmers have invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_tool">a lot of tools</a> to make their lives easier.
This volume focuses on a few that individual developers use while writing software;
we hope future volumes
will explore those used in the applications that programmers build.</p>
<p><a class="crossref" href="#glossary">Appendix E</a> defines the terms we introduce in these lessons,
which in turn define their scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to process a program like any other piece of text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to turn a program into a data structure that can be analyzed and modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What design patterns are and which ones are used most often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How programs are executed and how we can control and inspect their execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How we can analyze programs' performance in order to make sensible design tradeoffs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to find and run code modules on the fly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<h2 id="introduction-layout">Section 1.3:  How are these lessons laid out?</h2>
<p>We display JavaScript source code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">for (const thing in collection) {
  console.log(thing)
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and Unix shell commands like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">for filename in *.dat
do
    cut -d , -f 10 $filename
done
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Data and output are shown in italics:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Package,Releases
0,1
0-0,0
0-0-1,1
00print-lol,2
00smalinux,0
01changer,0
</code></pre>
<p>We occasionally wrap lines in source code in unnatural ways to make listings fit the printed page,
and sometimes use <code>...</code> to show where lines have been omitted.
Where we need to break lines of output for the same reason,
we end all but the last line with a single backslash <code>\</code>.
The full listings are all available in [our Git repository][stjs-repo]
and <a href="https://stjs.tech/">on our website</a>.</p>
<p>Finally,
we write functions as <code>functionName</code> rather than <code>functionName()</code>;
the latter is more common,
but people don't use <code>objectName{}</code> for objects or <code>arrayName[]</code> for arrays,
and the empty parentheses makes it hard to tell
whether we're talking about "the function itself" or "a call to the function with no parameters".</p>
<h2 id="introduction-history">Section 1.4:  How did we get here?</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s,
the <span class="indexentry" index-key="University of Toronto" markdown="1">University of Toronto</span> asked <span class="indexentry" index-key="Wilson, Greg" markdown="1"><a href="https://third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a></span>
to teach an undergraduate course on software architecture.
After delivering the course three times he told the university they should cancel it:
between them,
the dozen textbooks he had purchased with the phrase "software architecture" in their titles
devoted a total of less than 30 pages to describing the designs of actual systems.</p>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<p>Frustrated by that,
he and <span class="indexentry" index-key="Oram, Andy" markdown="1"><a href="http://www.praxagora.com/">Andy Oram</a></span> persuaded some well-known programmers to contribute a chapter each
to a collection called <em>Beautiful Code</em> <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Oram2007">Oram2007</a></span>,
which went on to win the Jolt Award in 2007.
Entries in the book described everything from figuring out whether three points are on a line
to core components of Linux
and the software for the Mars Rover,
but the breadth that made them fun to read
also meant they weren't particularly useful for teaching.</p>
<p>To fix that,
Greg Wilson, <span class="indexentry" index-key="Brown, Amy" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.amyrhodabrown.com/">Amy Brown</a></span>,
<span class="indexentry" index-key="Armstrong, Tavish" markdown="1"><a href="http://tavisharmstrong.com/">Tavish Armstrong</a></span>,
and <span class="indexentry" index-key="DiBernardo, Mike" markdown="1"><a href="https://mikedebo.com/">Mike DiBernardo</a></span>
edited a four-book series between 2011 and 2016 called <em><a href="https://aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open Source Applications</a></em>.
In the first two volumes,
the creators of fifty open source projects described their systems' designs;
the third book explored the performance of those systems,
while in the fourth volume contributors built scale models of common tools
as a way of demonstrating how those tools worked.
These books were closer to what an instructor would need for an undergraduate class on software design,
but still not quite right:
the intended audience would probably not be familiar with many of the problem domains,
and since each author used the programming language of their choice,
much of the code would be hard to understand.</p>
<p><em>Software Tools in JavaScript</em> is meant to address these shortcomings:
all of the code is written in one language,
and the examples are all tools that programmers use daily.
Most of the programs are less than 60 lines long and the longest is less than 200;
we believe each chapter can be covered in class in 1-2 hours,
while the exercises range in difficulty from a few minutes to a couple of days.</p>

</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="systems-programming">Chapter 2: Systems Programming</h1>
<p>The biggest difference between JavaScript and most other programming languages
is that many operations in JavaScript are <span class="indexentry" index-key="asynchronous execution;execution!asynchronous" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#asynchronous" markdown="1">asynchronous</a></span>.
Its designers didn't want browsers to freeze while waiting for data to arrive or for users to click on things,
so operations that might be slow are implemented by describing now what to do later.
And since anything that touches the hard drive is slow from a processor's point of view,
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> implements <span class="indexentry" index-key="filesystem operations" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#filesystem" markdown="1">filesystem</a></span> operations the same way.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>How slow is slow?</h3>
<p><span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Gregg2020">Gregg2020</a></span> used the analogy in <a class="tblref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-times">Table 2.1</a>
to show how long it takes a computer to do different things
if we imagine that one CPU cycle is equivalent to one second.</p>

<p>Early JavaScript programs used <span class="indexentry" index-key="callback function" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#callback" markdown="1">callback functions</a></span> to describe asynchronous operations,
but as we're about to see,
callbacks can be hard to understand even in small programs.
In 2015,
the language's developers standardized a higher-level tool called promises
to make callbacks easier to manage,
and more recently they have added new keywords called <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> to make it easier still.
We need to understand all three layers in order to debug things when they go wrong,
so this chapter explores callbacks,
while <a class="crossref" href="#async-programming">Chapter 3</a> shows how promises and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> work.
This chapter also shows how to read and write files and directories with Node's standard libraries,
because we're going to be doing that a lot.</p>
<h2 id="systems-programming-ls">Section 2.1:  How can we list a directory?</h2>
<p>To start,
let's try listing the contents of a directory the way we would in <span class="indexentry" index-key="Python" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></span>
or <span class="indexentry" index-key="Java" markdown="1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a></span>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'

const srcDir = process.argv[2]
const results = fs.readdir(srcDir)
for (const name of results) {
  console.log(name)
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">We use <span class="indexentry" index-key="import module" markdown="1"><code>import <em>module</em> from 'source'</code></span> to load the library <code><em>source</em></code>
and assign its contents to <code><em>module</em></code>.
After that,
we can refer to things in the library using <code><em>module.component</em></code>
just as we refer to things in any other object.
We can use whatever name we want for the module,
which allows us to give short nicknames to libraries with long names;
we will take advantage of this in future chapters.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><code>require</code> versus <code>import</code></h3>
<p>In 2015, a new version of JavaScript called ES6 introduced
the keyword <span class="indexentry" index-key="import vs. require;require vs. import" markdown="1"><code>import</code></span> for importing modules.
It improves on the older <code>require</code> function in several ways,
but Node still uses <code>require</code> by default.
To tell it to use <code>import</code>,
we have added <code>"type": "module"</code> at the top level of our Node <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our little program uses the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html"><code>fs</code></a> library
which contains functions to create directories, read or delete files, etc.
(Its name is short for "filesystem".)
We tell the program what to list using <span class="indexentry" index-key="command-line argument" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#command_line_argument" markdown="1">command-line arguments</a></span>,
which Node automatically stores in an array called <span class="indexentry" index-key="process.argv" markdown="1"><code>process.argv</code></span>.
<code>process.argv[0]</code> is the name of the program used to run our code (in this case <code>node</code>),
while <code>process.argv[1]</code> is the name of our program (in this case <code>list-dir-wrong.js</code>);
the rest of <code>process.argv</code> holds whatever arguments we gave at the command line when we ran the program,
so <code>process.argv[2]</code> is the first argument after the name of our program (<a class="figref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-process-argv">Figure 2.1</a>):</p>
<figure id="systems-programming-process-argv">
<img alt="Command-line arguments in `process.argv`" src="./systems-programming/figures/process-argv.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 2.1: How Node stores command-line arguments in <code>process.argv</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<p>If we run this program with the name of a directory as its argument,
<code>fs.readdir</code> returns the names of the things in that directory as an array of strings.
The program uses <code>for (const name of results)</code> to loop over the contents of that array.
We could use <code>let</code> instead of <code>const</code>,
but it's good practice to declare things as <span class="indexentry" index-key="const declaration!advantages of" markdown="1"><code>const</code></span> wherever possible
so that anyone reading the program knows the variable isn't actually going to vary---doing
this reduces the <span class="indexentry" index-key="cognitive load" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#cognitive_load" markdown="1">cognitive load</a></span> on people reading the program.
Finally,
<span class="indexentry" index-key="console.log" markdown="1"><code>console.log</code></span> is JavaScript's equivalent of other languages' <code>print</code> command;
its strange name comes from the fact that
its original purpose was to create <a class="glossref" href="#log_message" markdown="1">log messages</a> in the browser <a class="glossref" href="#console" markdown="1">console</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,
our program doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node list-dir-wrong.js .
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">node:internal/process/esm_loader:74
    internalBinding('errors').triggerUncaughtException(

</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The error message comes from something we didn't write whose source we would struggle to read.
If we look for the name of our file (<code>list-dir-wrong.js</code>)
we see the error occurred on line 4;
everything above that is inside <code>fs.readdir</code>,
while everything below it is Node loading and running our program.</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>fs.readdir</code> doesn't return anything.
Instead,
its documentation says that it needs a callback function
that tells it what to do when data is available,
so we need to explore those in order to make our program work.</p>

<h2 id="systems-programming-callback">Section 2.2:  What is a callback function?</h2>
<p>JavaScript uses a <span class="indexentry" index-key="single-threaded execution;execution!single-threaded" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#single_threaded" markdown="1">single-threaded</a></span> programming model:
as the introduction to this lesson said,
it splits operations like file I/O into "please do this" and "do this when data is available".
<code>fs.readdir</code> is the first part,
but we need to write a function that specifies the second part.</p>
<p>JavaScript saves a reference to this function
and calls with a specific set of parameters when our data is ready
(<a class="figref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-callbacks">Figure 2.2</a>).
Those parameters defined a standard <span class="indexentry" index-key="protocol!API as;API!as protocol" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#protocol" markdown="1">protocol</a></span>
for connecting to libraries,
just like the USB standard allows us to plug hardware devices together.</p>

<img alt="Running callbacks" src="./systems-programming/figures/callbacks.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 2.2: How JavaScript runs callback functions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This corrected program gives <code>fs.readdir</code> a callback function called <code>listContents</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'

const listContents = (err, files) =&gt; {
  console.log('running callback')
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    for (const name of files) {
      console.log(name)
    }
  }
}

const srcDir = process.argv[2]
fs.readdir(srcDir, listContents)
console.log('last line of program')
</code></pre>
<p class="continue"><span class="indexentry" index-key="callback function!conventions for" markdown="1">Node callbacks</span>
always get an error (if there is any) as their first argument
and the result of a successful function call as their second.
The function can tell the difference by checking to see if the error argument is <code>null</code>.
If it is, the function lists the directory's contents with <code>console.log</code>,
otherwise, it uses <code>console.error</code> to display the error message.
Let's run the program with the <a class="glossref" href="#current_working_directory" markdown="1">current working directory</a>
(written as '.')
as an argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node list-dir-function-defined.js .

<p>Nothing that follows will make sense if we don't understand
the order in which Node executes the statements in this program

<li>
<p>Execute the first line to load the <code>fs</code> library.</p>

This makes it easier to see what's going to happen when the operation completes,
though it means the order of execution is quite different from the order of reading
(<a class="figref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-anonymous-functions">Figure 2.4</a>).
Using an anonymous function gives us the final version of our program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'

const srcDir = process.argv[2]
fs.readdir(srcDir, (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    for (const name of files) {
      console.log(name)
    }
  }
})

<h3>Functions are data</h3>
<p>As we noted above,
a function is just <span class="indexentry" index-key="code!as data" markdown="1">another kind of data</span>.
Instead of being made up of numbers, characters, or pixels, it is made up of instructions,
but these are stored in memory like anything else.
Defining a function on the fly is no different from defining an array in-place using <code>[1, 3, 5]</code>,
and passing a function as an argument to another function is no different from passing an array.
We are going to rely on this insight over and over again in the coming lessons.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="systems-programming-fileset">Section 2.4:  How can we select a set of files?</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to copy some files instead of listing a directory's contents.
Depending on the situation
we might want to copy only those files given on the command line
or all files except some explicitly excluded.
What we <em>don't</em> want to have to do is list the files one by one;
instead,
we want to be able to write patterns like <code>*.js</code>.</p>
<p>To find files that match patterns like that,
we can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob"><code>glob</code></a> module.
(To <span class="indexentry" index-key="globbing" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#globbing" markdown="1">glob</a></span> (short for "global") is an old Unix term for matching a set of files by name.)
The <code>glob</code> module provides a function that takes a pattern and a callback
and does something with every filename that matched the pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'

glob('**/*.*', (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    for (const filename of files) {
      console.log(filename)
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">copy-file-filtered.js
copy-file-unfiltered.js
copy-file-unfiltered.out
copy-file-unfiltered.sh

...
x-trace-anonymous.md
x-trace-anonymous/trace.js
x-trace-callback.md
x-trace-callback/trace.js
x-where-is-node.md
</code></pre>
<p>The leading <code>**</code> means "recurse into subdirectories",
while <code>*.*</code> means "any characters followed by '.' followed by any characters"
(<a class="figref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-globbing">Figure 2.5</a>).
Names that don't match <code>*.*</code> won't be included,
and by default,
neither are names that start with a '.' character.
This is another old Unix convention:
files and directories whose names have a leading '.'
usually contain configuration information for various programs,
so most commands will leave them alone unless told to do otherwise.</p>

<img alt="Matching filenames with `glob`" src="./systems-programming/figures/globbing.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 2.5: Using `glob` patterns to match filenames.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This program works,
but we probably don't want to copy Emacs backup files whose names end with <code>~</code>.
We can get rid of them by <span class="indexentry" index-key="globbing!filtering results" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#filter" markdown="1">filtering</a></span> the list that <code>glob</code> returns:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'

glob('**/*.*', (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    files = files.filter((f) =&gt; { return !f.endsWith('~') })
    for (const filename of files) {
      console.log(filename)
    }
  }
})

</code></pre>
<p><span class="indexentry" index-key="Array.filter" markdown="1"><code>Array.filter</code></span> creates a new array
containing all the items of the original array that pass a test
(<a class="figref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-array-filter">Figure 2.6</a>).
The test is specified as a callback function
that <code>Array.filter</code> calls once once for each item.
This function must return a <a class="glossref" href="#boolean" markdown="1">Boolean</a>
that tells <code>Array.filter</code> whether to keep the item in the new array or not.
<code>Array.filter</code> does not modify the original array,
so we can filter our original list of filenames several times if we want to.</p>
<figure id="systems-programming-array-filter">
<img alt="Using `Array.filter`" src="./systems-programming/figures/array-filter.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 2.6: Selecting array elements using `Array.filter`.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can make our globbing program more idiomatic by
removing the parentheses around the single parameter
and writing just the expression we want the function to return:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'

glob('**/*.*', (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    files = files.filter(f =&gt; !f.endsWith('~'))
    for (const filename of files) {
      console.log(filename)
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>However,
it turns out that <code>glob</code> will filter for us.
According to its documentation,
the function takes an <code>options</code> object full of key-value settings
that control its behavior.
This is another common pattern in Node libraries:
rather than accepting a large number of rarely-used parameters,
a function can take a single object full of settings.</p>
<p>If we use this,
our program becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'

glob('**/*.*', { ignore: '*~' }, (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    for (const filename of files) {
      console.log(filename)
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Notice that we don't quote the key in the <code>options</code> object.
The keys in objects are almost always strings,
and if a string is simple enough that it won't confuse the parser,
we don't need to put quotes around it.
Here,
"simple enough" means "looks like it could be a variable name",
or equivalently "contains only letters, digits, and the underscore".</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>No one knows everything</h3>
<p>We combined <code>glob.glob</code> and <code>Array.filter</code> in our functions for more than a year
before someone pointed out the <code>ignore</code> option for <code>glob.glob</code>.
This shows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Life is short,
    so most of us find a way to solve the problem in front of us
    and re-use it rather than looking for something better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code reviews aren't just about finding bugs:
    they are also the most effective way to transfer knowledge between programmers.
    Even if someone is much more experienced than you,
    there's a good chance you might have stumbled over a better way to do something
    than the one they're using (see point #1 above).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>To finish off our globbing program,
let's specify a source directory on the command line and include that in the pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'

const srcDir = process.argv[2]

glob(`${srcDir}/**/*.*`, { ignore: '*~' }, (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    for (const filename of files) {
      console.log(filename)
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">This program uses <span class="indexentry" index-key="string interpolation" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#string_interpolation" markdown="1">string interpolation</a></span>
to insert the value of <code>srcDir</code> into a string.
The template string is written in back quotes,
and JavaScript converts every expression written as <code>${expression}</code> to text.
We could create the pattern by concatenating strings using
<code>srcDir + '/**/*.*'</code>,
but most programmers find interpolation easier to read.</p>
<h2 id="systems-programming-copy">Section 2.5:  How can we copy a set of files?</h2>
<p>If we want to copy a set of files instead of just listing them
we need a way to create the <a class="glossref" href="#path" markdown="1">paths</a> of the files we are going to create.
If our program takes a second argument that specifies the desired output directory,
we can construct the full output path by replacing the name of the source directory with that path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'

const [srcDir, dstDir] = process.argv.slice(2)

glob(`${srcDir}/**/*.*`, { ignore: '*~' }, (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    for (const srcName of files) {
      const dstName = srcName.replace(srcDir, dstDir)
      console.log(srcName, dstName)
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">This program uses <span class="indexentry" index-key="destructuring assignment;assignment!destructuring" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#destructuring_assignment" markdown="1">destructuring assignment</a></span>
to create two variables at once
by unpacking the elements of an array
(<a class="figref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-destructuring-assignment">Figure 2.7</a>).
It only works if the array contains the enough elements,
i.e.,
if both a source and destination are given on the command line;
we'll add a check for that in the exercises.</p>
<figure id="systems-programming-destructuring-assignment">
<img alt="Matching values with destructuring assignment" src="./systems-programming/figures/destructuring-assignment.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 2.7: Assigning many values at once by destructuring.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A more serious problem is that
this program only works if the destination directory already exists:
<code>fs</code> and equivalent libraries in other languages usually won't create directories for us automatically.
The need to do this comes up so often that there is a function called <code>ensureDir</code> to do it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'
import fs from 'fs-extra'
import path from 'path'

const [srcRoot, dstRoot] = process.argv.slice(2)

glob(`${srcRoot}/**/*.*`, { ignore: '*~' }, (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    for (const srcName of files) {
      const dstName = srcName.replace(srcRoot, dstRoot)
      const dstDir = path.dirname(dstName)
      fs.ensureDir(dstDir, (err) =&gt; {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err)
        }
      })
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we import from <code>fs-extra</code> instead of <code>fs</code>;
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra"><code>fs-extra</code></a> module provides some useful utilities on top of <code>fs</code>.
We also use <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/path.html"><code>path</code></a> to manipulate pathnames
rather than concatenating or interpolating strings
because there are a lot of tricky <a class="glossref" href="#edge_case" markdown="1">edge cases</a> in pathnames
that the authors of that module have figured out for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Using distinct names</h3>
<p>We are now calling our command-line arguments <code>srcRoot</code> and <code>dstRoot</code>
rather than <code>srcDir</code> and <code>dstDir</code>.
We originally used <code>dstDir</code> as both
the name of the top-level destination directory (from the command line)
and the name of the particular output directory to create.
This was legal,
since every function creates
a new <span class="indexentry" index-key="scope!of variable definitions;variable definition!scope" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#scope" markdown="1">scope</a></span>,
but hard for people to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our file copying program currently creates empty destination directories
but doesn't actually copy any files.
Let's use <code>fs.copy</code> to do that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob'
import fs from 'fs-extra'
import path from 'path'

const [srcRoot, dstRoot] = process.argv.slice(2)

glob(`${srcRoot}/**/*.*`, { ignore: '*~' }, (err, files) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    for (const srcName of files) {
      const dstName = srcName.replace(srcRoot, dstRoot)
      const dstDir = path.dirname(dstName)
      fs.ensureDir(dstDir, (err) =&gt; {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err)
        } else {
          fs.copy(srcName, dstName, (err) =&gt; {
            if (err) {
              console.error(err)
            }
          })
        }
      })
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>The program now has three levels of callback
(<a class="figref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-triple-callback">Figure 2.8</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When <code>glob</code> has data, do things and then call <code>ensureDir</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When <code>ensureDir</code> completes, copy a file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When <code>copy</code> finishes, check the error status.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<figure id="systems-programming-triple-callback">

<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 2.8: Three levels of callback in the running example.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our program looks like it should work,
but if we try to copy everything in the directory containing these lessons
we get an error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">rm -rf /tmp/out
mkdir /tmp/out
node copy-file-unfiltered.js ../node_modules /tmp/out 2&gt;&amp;1 | head -n 6
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, chmod \

  errno: -2,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'chmod',
  path: '/tmp/out/@nodelib/fs.stat/README.md'
}
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that <code>node_modules/fs.stat</code> and <code>node_modules/fs.walk</code> match our globbing expression,
but are directories rather than files.
To prevent our program from trying to use <code>fs.copy</code> on directories,
we must use <code>fs.stat</code> to get the properties of the thing whose name <code>glob</code> has given us
and then check if it's a file.
The name "stat" is short for "status",
and since the status of something in the filesystem can be very complex,
<span class="indexentry" index-key="fs.stat" markdown="1"><code>fs.stat</code></span> returns <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats">an object with methods that can answer common questions</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the final version of our file copying program:</p>

<p>Callbacks work,
but they are hard to read and debug,
which means they only "work" in a limited sense.
JavaScript's developers added <span class="indexentry" index-key="promise!as alternative to callback" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#promise" markdown="1">promises</a></span> to the language in 2015
to make callbacks easier to write and understand,
and more recently they added the keywords <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> as well
to make asynchronous programming easier still.
To show how these work,
we will create a <a class="glossref" href="#class" markdown="1">class</a> of our own called <code>Pledge</code>
that provides the same core features as promises.
Our explanation was inspired by <span class="indexentry" index-key="Huffine, Trey" markdown="1"><a href="https://medium.com/@treyhuffine">Trey Huffine's</a></span> <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understand-javascript-promises-by-building-a-promise-from-scratch-84c0fd855720">tutorial</a>,

<h2 id="async-programming-manage">Section 3.1:  How can we manage asynchronous execution?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is built around an <span class="indexentry" index-key="event loop;execution!event loop" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#event_loop" markdown="1">event loop</a></span>.
Every task is represented by an entry in a queue;
the event loop repeatedly takes a task from the front of the queue,
runs it,
and adds any new tasks that it creates to the back of the queue to run later.
Only one task runs at a time;
each has its own <a class="glossref" href="#call_stack" markdown="1">call stack</a>,
but objects can be shared between tasks
(<a class="figref" href="../async-programming/#async-programming-event-loop">Figure 3.1</a>).</p>

<p>Most tasks execute all the code available in the order it is written.

this one-line program uses <span class="indexentry" index-key="Array.forEach" markdown="1"><code>Array.forEach</code></span>

<p>However,
a handful of special built-in functions make <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> switch tasks
or add new tasks to the run queue.
For example,
<span class="indexentry" index-key="setTimeout" markdown="1"><code>setTimeout</code></span> tells Node to run a callback function
after a certain number of milliseconds have passed.
Its first argument is a callback function that takes no arguments,
and its second is the delay.
When <code>setTimeout</code> is called,
Node sets the callback aside for the requested length of time,
then adds it to the run queue.
(This means the task runs <em>at least</em> the specified number of milliseconds later).</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Why zero arguments?</h3>
<p><code>setTimeout</code>'s requirement that callback functions take no arguments
is another example of a <span class="indexentry" index-key="protocol!API as;API!as protocol" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#protocol" markdown="1">protocol</a></span>.
One way to think about it is that protocols allow old code to use new code:
whoever wrote <code>setTimeout</code> couldn't know what specific tasks we want to delay,
so they specified a way to wrap up any task at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the listing below shows,
the original task can generate many new tasks before it completes,
and those tasks can run in a different order than the order in which they were created
(<a class="figref" href="../async-programming/#async-programming-set-timeout">Figure 3.2</a>).</p>

<h2 id="async-programming-promises">Section 3.2:  How do promises work?</h2>
<p>Before we start building our own <span class="indexentry" index-key="promise!behavior" markdown="1">promises</span>,
let's look at how we want them to work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Pledge from './pledge.js'

new Pledge((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  console.log('top of a single then clause')
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    console.log('about to call resolve callback')
    resolve('this is the result')
  }, 0)
}).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(`in 'then' with "${value}"`)
  return 'first then value'
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">top of a single then clause
about to call resolve callback
in 'then' with "this is the result"
</code></pre>
<p>This short program creates a new <code>Pledge</code>
with a callback that takes two other callbacks as arguments:
<span class="indexentry" index-key="promise!resolve;resolve promise" markdown="1"><code>resolve</code></span> (which will run when everything worked)
and <span class="indexentry" index-key="promise!reject;reject promise" markdown="1"><code>reject</code></span> (which will run when something went wrong).
The top-level callback does the first part of what we want to do,
i.e.,
whatever we want to run before we expect a delay;
for demonstration purposes, we will use <code>setTimeout</code> with zero delay to switch tasks.
Once this task resumes,
we call the <code>resolve</code> callback to trigger whatever is supposed to happen after the delay.</p>
<p>Now look at the line with <code>then</code>.
This is a <a class="glossref" href="#method" markdown="1">method</a> of the <code>Pledge</code> object we just created,
and its job is to do whatever we want to do after the delay.
The argument to <code>then</code> is yet another callback function;
it will get the value passed to <code>resolve</code>,
which is how the first part of the action communicates with the second
(<a class="figref" href="../async-programming/#async-programming-resolve">Figure 3.3</a>).</p>
<figure id="async-programming-resolve">
<img alt="How promises resolve" src="./async-programming/figures/resolve.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 3.3: Order of operations when a promise resolves.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to make this work,
<code>Pledge</code>'s <a class="glossref" href="#constructor" markdown="1">constructor</a> must take a single function called <code>action</code>.
This function must take take two callbacks as arguments:
what to do if the action completes successfully
and what to do if it doesn't (i.e., how to handle errors).
<code>Pledge</code> will provide these callbacks to the action at the right times.</p>
<p><code>Pledge</code> also needs two methods:
<span class="indexentry" index-key="promise!then" markdown="1"><code>then</code></span> to enable more actions
and <span class="indexentry" index-key="promise!catch" markdown="1"><code>catch</code></span> to handle errors.
To simplify things just a little bit,
we will allow users to <span class="indexentry" index-key="method chaining" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#method_chaining" markdown="1">chain</a></span> as many <code>then</code>s as they want,
but only allow one <code>catch</code>.</p>
<h2 id="async-programming-fluent">Section 3.3:  How can we chain operations together?</h2>
<p>A <span class="indexentry" index-key="fluent interface;programming style!fluent interface" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#fluent_interface" markdown="1">fluent interface</a></span>
is a style of object-oriented programming
in which the methods of an object return <code>this</code>
so that method calls can be chained together.
For example,
if our class is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Fluent {
  constructor () {...}

  first (top) {
    ...do something with top...
    return this
  }

  second (left, right) {
    ...do something with left and right...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">then we can write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  const f = new Fluent()
  f.first('hello').second('and', 'goodbye')
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">or even</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  (new Fluent()).first('hello').second('and', 'goodbye')
</code></pre>
<p><code>Array</code>'s fluent interface lets us write expressions like
<code>Array.filter(...).map(...).map(...)</code>
that are usually more readable than assigning intermediate results to temporary variables.</p>
<p>If the original action given to our <code>Pledge</code> completes successfully,
the <code>Pledge</code> gives us a value by calling the <code>resolve</code> callback.
We pass this value to the first <code>then</code>,
pass the result of that <code>then</code> to the second one,
and so on.
If any of them fail and throw an <span class="indexentry" index-key="exception!in promise" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#exception" markdown="1">exception</a></span>,
we pass that exception to the error handler.
Putting it all together,
the whole class looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Pledge {
  constructor (action) {
    this.actionCallbacks = []
    this.errorCallback = () =&gt; {}
    action(this.onResolve.bind(this), this.onReject.bind(this))
  }

  then (thenHandler) {
    this.actionCallbacks.push(thenHandler)
    return this
  }

  catch (errorHandler) {
    this.errorCallback = errorHandler
    return this
  }

  onResolve (value) {
    let storedValue = value
    try {
      this.actionCallbacks.forEach((action) =&gt; {
        storedValue = action(storedValue)
      })
    } catch (err) {
      this.actionCallbacks = []
      this.onReject(err)
    }
  }

  onReject (err) {
    this.errorCallback(err)
  }
}

export default Pledge
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Binding <code>this</code></h3>
<p><code>Pledge</code>'s constructor makes two calls to a special function called <span class="indexentry" index-key="bind method to object" markdown="1"><code>bind</code></span>.
When we create an object <code>obj</code> and call a method <code>meth</code>,
JavaScript sets the special variable <code>this</code> to <code>obj</code> inside <code>meth</code>.
If we use a method as a callback,
though,
<code>this</code> isn't automatically set to the correct object.
To convert the method to a plain old function with the right <code>this</code>,
we have to use <code>bind</code>.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind">The documentation</a> has more details and examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's create a <code>Pledge</code> and return a value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Pledge from './pledge.js'

new Pledge((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  console.log('top of a single then clause')
}).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(`then with "${value}"`)
  return 'first then value'
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">top of a single then clause
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Why didn't this work?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can't use <code>return</code> with pledges
    because the call stack of the task that created the pledge is gone
    by the time the pledge executes.
    Instead, we must call <code>resolve</code> or <code>reject</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We haven't done anything that defers execution,
    i.e.,
    there is no call to <code>setTimeout</code>, <code>setImmediate</code>,
    or anything else that would switch tasks.
    Our original motivating example got this right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This example shows how we can chain actions together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Pledge from './pledge.js'

new Pledge((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  console.log('top of action callback with double then and a catch')
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    console.log('about to call resolve callback')
    resolve('initial result')
    console.log('after resolve callback')
  }, 0)
  console.log('end of action callback')
}).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(`first then with "${value}"`)
  return 'first value'
}).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(`second then with "${value}"`)
  return 'second value'
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">top of action callback with double then and a catch
end of action callback
about to call resolve callback
first then with "initial result"
second then with "first value"
after resolve callback
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Notice that inside each <code>then</code> we <em>do</em> use <code>return</code>
because these clauses all run in a single task.
As we will see in the next section,
the full implementation of <code>Promise</code> allows us to run both normal code
and delayed tasks inside <code>then</code> handlers.</p>
<p>Finally,
in this example we explicitly signal a problem by calling <code>reject</code>
to make sure our error handling does what it's supposed to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Pledge from './pledge.js'

new Pledge((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  console.log('top of action callback with deliberate error')
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    console.log('about to reject on purpose')
    reject('error on purpose')
  }, 0)
}).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(`should not be here with "${value}"`)
}).catch((err) =&gt; {
  console.log(`in error handler with "${err}"`)
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">top of action callback with deliberate error
about to reject on purpose
in error handler with "error on purpose"
</code></pre>
<h2 id="async-programming-real">Section 3.4:  How are real promises different?</h2>
<p>Let's rewrite our chained pledge with built-in promises:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  console.log('top of action callback with double then and a catch')
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    console.log('about to call resolve callback')
    resolve('initial result')
    console.log('after resolve callback')
  }, 0)
  console.log('end of action callback')
}).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(`first then with "${value}"`)
  return 'first value'
}).then((value) =&gt; {
  console.log(`second then with "${value}"`)
  return 'second value'
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">top of action callback with double then and a catch
end of action callback
about to call resolve callback
after resolve callback
first then with "initial result"
second then with "first value"
</code></pre>
<p>It looks almost the same,
but if we read the output carefully
we can see that the callbacks run <em>after</em> the main program finishes.
This is a signal that Node is delaying the execution of the code in the <code>then</code> handler.</p>
<p>A very common pattern is to return another promise from inside <code>then</code>
so that the next <code>then</code> is called on the returned promise,
not on the original promise
(<a class="figref" href="../async-programming/#async-programming-chained">Figure 3.4</a>).
This is another way to implement a fluent interface:
if a method of one object returns a second object,
we can call a method of the second object immediately.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const delay = (message) =&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    console.log(`constructing promise: ${message}`)

<img alt="Chained promises" src="./async-programming/figures/chained.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 3.4: Chaining promises to make asynchronous operations depend on each other.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We therefore have three rules for chaining promises:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If our code can run synchronously, just put it in <code>then</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we want to use our own asynchronous function,
    it must create and return a promise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally,
    if we want to use a library function that relies on callbacks,
    we have to convert it to use promises.
    Doing this is called <a class="glossref" href="#promisification" markdown="1">promisification</a>
    (because programmers will rarely pass up an opportunity add a bit of jargon to the world),
    and most functions in the Node have already been promisified.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="async-programming-tools">Section 3.5:  How can we build tools with promises?</h2>
<p>Promises may seem more complex than callbacks right now,
but that's because we're looking at how they work rather than at how to use them.
To explore the latter subject,
let's use promises to build a program to count the number of lines in a set of files.
A few moments of search on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> turns up a promisified version of <code>fs-extra</code>
called <code>fs-extra-promise</code>,
so we will rely on it for file operations.</p>
<p>Our first step is to count the lines in a single file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs-extra-promise'

const filename = process.argv[2]

fs.readFileAsync(filename, { encoding: 'utf-8' })
  .then(data =&gt; {
    const length = data.split('\n').length - 1
    console.log(`${filename}: ${length}`)
  })
  .catch(err =&gt; {
    console.error(err.message)
  })
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node count-lines-single-file.js count-lines-single-file.js
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">count-lines-single-file.js: 12
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Character encoding</h3>
<p>A <span class="indexentry" index-key="character encoding" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#character_encoding" markdown="1">character encoding</a></span> specifies how characters are stored as bytes.
The most widely used is <span class="indexentry" index-key="UTF-8;character encoding!UTF-8" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#utf_8" markdown="1">UTF-8</a></span>,
which stores characters common in Western European languages in a single byte
and uses multi-byte sequences for other symbols.
If we don't specify a character encoding,
<code>fs.readFileAsync</code> gives us an array of bytes rather than a string of characters.
We can tell we've made this mistake when we try to call a method of <code>String</code>
and Node tells us we can't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next step is to count the lines in multiple files.
We can use <code>glob-promise</code> to delay handling the output of <code>glob</code>,
but we need some way to create a separate task to count the lines in each file
and to wait until those line counts are available before exiting our program.</p>
<p>The tool we want is <span class="indexentry" index-key="Promise.all" markdown="1"><code>Promise.all</code></span>,
which waits until all of the promises in an array have completed.
To make our program a little more readable,
we will put the creation of the promise for each file in a separate function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob-promise'
import fs from 'fs-extra-promise'

const main = (srcDir) =&gt; {
  glob(`${srcDir}/**/*.*`)
    .then(files =&gt; Promise.all(files.map(f =&gt; lineCount(f))))
    .then(counts =&gt; counts.forEach(c =&gt; console.log(c)))
    .catch(err =&gt; console.log(err.message))
}

const lineCount = (filename) =&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    fs.readFileAsync(filename, { encoding: 'utf-8' })
      .then(data =&gt; resolve(data.split('\n').length - 1))
      .catch(err =&gt; reject(err))
  })
}

const srcDir = process.argv[2]
main(srcDir)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node count-lines-globbed-files.js .
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">10
1
12
4
1
...
3
2
5
2
14
</code></pre>
<p>However,
we want to display the names of the files whose lines we're counting along with the counts.
To do this our <code>then</code> must return two values.
We could put them in an array,
but it's better practice to construct a temporary object with named fields
(<a class="figref" href="../async-programming/#async-programming-temporary-named-fields">Figure 3.5</a>).
This approach allows us to add or rearrange fields without breaking code
and also serves as a bit of documentation.
With this change
our line-counting program becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import glob from 'glob-promise'
import fs from 'fs-extra-promise'

const main = (srcDir) =&gt; {
  glob(`${srcDir}/**/*.*`)
    .then(files =&gt; Promise.all(files.map(f =&gt; lineCount(f))))
    .then(counts =&gt; counts.forEach(
      c =&gt; console.log(`${c.lines}: ${c.name}`)))
    .catch(err =&gt; console.log(err.message))
}

const lineCount = (filename) =&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    fs.readFileAsync(filename, { encoding: 'utf-8' })
      .then(data =&gt; resolve({
        name: filename,
        lines: data.split('\n').length - 1
      }))
      .catch(err =&gt; reject(err))
  })
}

const srcDir = process.argv[2]
main(srcDir)

<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 3.5: Creating temporary objects with named fields to carry values forward.</figcaption>

<p>As in <a class="crossref" href="#systems-programming">Chapter 2</a>,
this works until we run into a directory whose name name matches <code>*.*</code>,
which we do when counting the lines in the contents of <code>node_modules</code>.
The solution once again is to use <code>stat</code> to check if something is a file or not
before trying to read it.
And since <code>stat</code> returns an object that doesn't include the file's name,
we create another temporary object to pass information down the chain of <code>then</code>s.</p>

<p>Promises eliminate the deep nesting associated with callbacks of callbacks,

<h3>Translating code</h3>
<p>When Node sees <code>await</code> and <code>async</code>
it silently <span class="indexentry" index-key="promise!automatic creation of" markdown="1">converts</span> the code to use promises with <code>then</code>, <code>resolve</code>, and <code>reject</code>;
we will see how this works in <a class="crossref" href="#code-generator">Chapter 15</a>.
In order to provide a context for this transformation
we must put <code>await</code> inside a function that is declared to be <code>async</code>:
we can't simply write <code>await fs.statAsync(...)</code> at the top level of our program
outside a function.
This requirement is occasionally annoying,
but since we should be putting our code in functions anyway
it's hard to complain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see how much cleaner our code is with <code>await</code> and <code>async</code>,
let's rewrite our line counting program to use them.
First,
we modify the two helper functions to look like they're waiting for results and returning them.
They actually wrap their results in promises and return those,
but Node now takes care of that for us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const statPair = async (filename) =&gt; {
  const stats = await fs.statAsync(filename)
  return { filename, stats }
}

const lineCount = async (filename) =&gt; {
  const data = await fs.readFileAsync(filename, 'utf-8')
  return {
    filename,
    lines: data.split('\n').length - 1
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next,
we modify <code>main</code> to wait for things to complete.
We must still use <code>Promise.all</code> to handle the promises
that are counting lines for individual files,
but the result is less cluttered than our previous version.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = async (srcDir) =&gt; {
  const files = await glob(`${srcDir}/**/*.*`)
  const pairs = await Promise.all(
    files.map(async filename =&gt; await statPair(filename))
  )
  const filtered = pairs
    .filter(pair =&gt; pair.stats.isFile())
    .map(pair =&gt; pair.filename)
  const counts = await Promise.all(
    filtered.map(async name =&gt; await lineCount(name))
  )
  counts.forEach(
    ({ filename, lines }) =&gt; console.log(`${lines}: ${filename}`)
  )
}

const srcDir = process.argv[2]
main(srcDir)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="async-programming-errors">Section 3.7:  How can we handle errors with asynchronous code?</h2>
<p>We created several intermediate variables in the line-counting program to make the steps clearer.
Doing this also helps with error handling:
to see how,
we will build up an example in stages.</p>
<p>First,
if we return a promise that fails without using <code>await</code>,
then our main function will finish running before the error occurs,
and our <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> doesn't help us
(<a class="figref" href="../async-programming/#async-programming-handling-errors">Figure 3.6</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">async function returnImmediately () {
  try {
    return Promise.reject(new Error('deliberate'))
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('caught exception')
  }
}

returnImmediately()
</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<img alt="Handling asynchronous errors" src="./async-programming/figures/handling-errors.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 3.6: Wrong and right ways to handle errors in asynchronous code.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One solution to this problem is to be consistent and always return something.
Because the function is declared <code>async</code>,
the <code>Error</code> in the code below is automatically wrapped in a promise
so we can use <code>.then</code> and <code>.catch</code> to handle it as before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">async function returnImmediately () {
  try {
    return Promise.reject(new Error('deliberate'))
  } catch (err) {
    return new Error('caught exception')
  }
}

const result = returnImmediately()
result.catch(err =&gt; console.log(`caller caught ${err}`))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">caller caught Error: deliberate
</code></pre>
<p>If instead we <span class="indexentry" index-key="exception!with await" markdown="1"><code>return await</code></span>,
the function waits until the promise runs before returning.
The promise is turned into an exception because it failed,
and since we're inside the scope of our <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> block,
everything works as we want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">async function returnAwait () {
  try {
    return await Promise.reject(new Error('deliberate'))
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('caught exception')
  }
}

returnAwait()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">caught exception
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">We prefer the second approach,
but whichever you choose,
please be consistent.</p>

</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="unit-test">Chapter 4: Unit Testing</h1>
<p>We have written many small programs in the previous two chapters,
but haven't really tested any of them.
That's OK for <span class="indexentry" index-key="exploratory programming" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#exploratory_programming" markdown="1">exploratory programming</a></span>,
but if our software is going to be used instead of just read,
we should try to make sure it works.</p>
<p>A tool for writing and running <span class="indexentry" index-key="unit test!requirements for" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#unit_test" markdown="1">unit tests</a></span> is a good first step.
Such a tool should:</p>
<ul>
<li>find files containing tests;</li>
<li>find the tests in those files;</li>
<li>run the tests;</li>
<li>capture their results; and</li>
<li>report each test's result and a summary of those results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our design is inspired by tools like <span class="indexentry" index-key="Mocha" markdown="1"><a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a></span> and <span class="indexentry" index-key="Jest" markdown="1"><a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a></span>,
which were in turn inspired by tools built for other languages
from the 1980s onward <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Meszaros2007">Meszaros2007</a>, <a class="bibref" href="#Tudose2020">Tudose2020</a></span>.</p>
<h2 id="unit-test-structure">Section 4.1:  How should we structure unit testing?</h2>
<p>As in other unit testing frameworks,
each test will be a function of zero arguments
so that the framework can run them all in the same way.
Each test will create a <span class="indexentry" index-key="fixture (in unit test);unit test!fixture" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#fixture" markdown="1">fixture</a></span> to be tested
and use <span class="indexentry" index-key="assertion!in unit test" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#assertion" markdown="1">assertions</a></span>
to compare the <span class="indexentry" index-key="actual result (in unit test);unit test!actual result" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#actual_result" markdown="1">actual result</a></span>
against the <span class="indexentry" index-key="expected result (in unit test);unit test!expected result" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#expected_result" markdown="1">expected result</a></span>.
The outcome can be exactly one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="indexentry" index-key="pass (in unit test);unit test!pass" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#pass_test" markdown="1">Pass</a></span>:
    the <span class="indexentry" index-key="test subject (in unit test);unit test!test subject" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#test_subject" markdown="1">test subject</a></span> works as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="indexentry" index-key="fail (in unit test);unit test!fail" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#fail_test" markdown="1">Fail</a></span>:
    something is wrong with the test subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="indexentry" index-key="error (in unit test);unit test!error" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#error_test" markdown="1">Error</a></span>:
    something wrong in the test itself,
    which means we don't know whether the test subject is working properly or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this work,
we need some way to distinguish failing tests from broken ones.
Our solution relies on the fact that exceptions are objects
and that a program can use <span class="indexentry" index-key="introspection!in unit testing" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#introspection" markdown="1">introspection</a></span>
to determine the class of an object.
If a test <span class="indexentry" index-key="exception!throw" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#throw_exception" markdown="1">throws an exception</a></span> whose class is <code>assert.AssertionError</code>,
then we will assume the exception came from
one of the assertions we put in the test as a check
(<a class="figref" href="../unit-test/#unit-test-mental-model">Figure 4.1</a>).
Any other kind of assertion indicates that the test itself contains an error.</p>

<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 4.1: Running tests that can pass, fail, or contain errors.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="unit-test-design">Section 4.2:  How can we separate registration, execution, and reporting?</h2>
<p>To start,
let's use a handful of <a class="glossref" href="#global_variable" markdown="1">global variables</a> to record tests and their results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// State of tests.
const HopeTests = []
let HopePass = 0
let HopeFail = 0
let HopeError = 0
</code></pre>
<p>We don't run tests immediately
because we want to wrap each one in our own <span class="indexentry" index-key="exception!handler" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#exception_handler" markdown="1">exception handler</a></span>.
Instead,
the function <code>hopeThat</code> saves a descriptive message and a callback function that implements a test
in the <code>HopeTest</code> array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Record a single test for running later.
const hopeThat = (message, callback) =&gt; {
  HopeTests.push([message, callback])
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Independence</h3>
<p>Because we're appending tests to an array,
they will be run in the order in which they are registered,
but we shouldn't rely on that.
Every unit test should work independently of every other
so that an error or failure in an early test
doesn't affect the result of a later one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally,
the function <code>main</code> runs all registered tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Run all of the tests that have been asked for and report summary.
const main = () =&gt; {
  HopeTests.forEach(([message, test]) =&gt; {
    try {
      test()
      HopePass += 1
    } catch (e) {
      if (e instanceof assert.AssertionError) {
        HopeFail += 1
      } else {
        HopeError += 1
      }
    }
  })

  console.log(`pass ${HopePass}`)
  console.log(`fail ${HopeFail}`)
  console.log(`error ${HopeError}`)
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">If a test completes without an exception, it passes.
If any of the <code>assert</code> calls inside the test raises an <code>AssertionError</code>,
the test fails,
and if it raises any other exception,
it's an error.
After all tests are run,
<code>main</code> reports the number of results of each kind.</p>
<p>Let's try it out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Something to test (doesn't handle zero properly).
const sign = (value) =&gt; {
  if (value &lt; 0) {
    return -1
  } else {
    return 1
  }
}

// These two should pass.
hopeThat('Sign of negative is -1', () =&gt; assert(sign(-3) === -1))
hopeThat('Sign of positive is 1', () =&gt; assert(sign(19) === 1))

// This one should fail.
hopeThat('Sign of zero is 0', () =&gt; assert(sign(0) === 0))

// This one is an error.
hopeThat('Sign misspelled is error', () =&gt; assert(sgn(1) === 1)) // eslint-disable-line

// Call the main driver.
main()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">pass 2
fail 1
error 1
</code></pre>
<p>This simple "framework" does what it's supposed to, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It doesn't tell us which tests have passed or failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those global variables should be consolidated somehow
    so that it's clear they belong together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't discover tests on its own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don't have a way to test things that are supposed to raise <code>AssertionError</code>.
    Putting assertions into code to check that it is behaving correctly
    is called <a class="glossref" href="#defensive_programming" markdown="1">defensive programming</a>;
    it's a good practice,
    but we should make sure those assertions are failing when they're supposed to,
    just as we should test our smoke detectors every once in a while.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="unit-test-registration">Section 4.3:  How should we structure test registration?</h2>
<p>The next version of our testing tool solves the first two problems in the original
by putting the testing machinery in a class.
It uses the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Singleton pattern;design pattern!Singleton" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#singleton_pattern" markdown="1">Singleton</a></span> <a class="glossref" href="#design_pattern" markdown="1">design pattern</a>
to ensure that only one object of that class is ever created <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Osmani2017">Osmani2017</a></span>.
Singletons are a way to manage global variables that belong together
like the ones we're using to record tests and their results.
As an extra benefit,
if we decide later that we need several copies of those variables,
we can just construct more instances of the class.</p>
<p>The file <code>hope.js</code> defines the class and exports one instance of it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  terse () {
    return this.cases()
      .map(([title, results]) =&gt; `${title}: ${results.length}`)
      .join(' ')
  }

  verbose () {
    let report = ''
    let prefix = ''
    for (const [title, results] of this.cases()) {
      report += `${prefix}${title}:`
      prefix = '\n'
      for (const r of results) {
        report += `${prefix}  ${r}`
      }
    }
    return report
  }

  cases () {
    return [
      ['passes', this.passes],
      ['fails', this.fails],
      ['errors', this.errors]]
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This strategy relies on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> executes the code in a JavaScript module as it loads it,
    which means that it runs <code>new Hope()</code> and exports the newly-created object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node <span class="indexentry" index-key="cache!modules;require!caching modules" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#caching" markdown="1">caches</a></span> modules
    so that a given module is only loaded once
    no matter how many times it is imported.
    This ensures that <code>new Hope()</code> really is only called once.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a program has imported <code>hope</code>,
it can call <code>Hope.test</code> to record a test for later execution
and <code>Hope.run</code> to execute all of the tests registered up until that point
(<a class="figref" href="../unit-test/#unit-test-hope-structure">Figure 4.2</a>).</p>
<figure id="unit-test-hope-structure">
<img alt="Recording and running tests" src="./unit-test/figures/hope-structure.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 4.2: Creating a singleton, recording tests, and running them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally,
our <code>Hope</code> class can report results as both a terse one-line summary and as a detailed listing.
It can also provide the titles and results of individual tests
so that if someone wants to format them in a different way (e.g., as HTML) they can do so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  terse () {
    return this.cases()
      .map(([title, results]) =&gt; `${title}: ${results.length}`)
      .join(' ')
  }

  verbose () {
    let report = ''
    let prefix = ''
    for (const [title, results] of this.cases()) {
      report += `${prefix}${title}:`
      prefix = '\n'
      for (const r of results) {
        report += `${prefix}  ${r}`
      }
    }
    return report
  }

  cases () {
    return [
      ['passes', this.passes],
      ['fails', this.fails],
      ['errors', this.errors]]
  }
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Who's calling?</h3>
<p><code>Hope.test</code> uses the <span class="indexentry" index-key="caller module" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/caller"><code>caller</code></a></span> module
to get the name of the function that is registering a test.
Reporting the test's name helps the user figure out where to start debugging;
getting it via introspection
rather than requiring the user to pass the function's name as a string
reduces typing
and guarantees that what we report is accurate.
Programmers will often copy, paste, and modify tests;
sooner or later (probably sooner) they will forget to modify
the copy-and-pasted function name being passed into <code>Hope.test</code>
and will then lose time trying to figure out why <code>test_this</code> is failing
when the failure is actually in <code>test_that</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="unit-test-cli">Section 4.4:  How can we build a command-line interface for testing?</h2>
<p>Most programmers don't enjoy writing tests,
so if we want them to do it,
we have to make it as painless as possible.
A couple of <code>import</code> statements to get <code>assert</code> and <code>hope</code>
and then one function call per test
is about as simple as we can make the tests themselves:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'
import hope from './hope.js'

hope.test('Sum of 1 and 2', () =&gt; assert((1 + 2) === 3))
</code></pre>
<p>But that just defines the tests---how will we find them so that we can run them?
One option is to require people to <code>import</code> each of the files containing tests
into another file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// all-the-tests.js

import './test-add.js'
import './test-sub.js'
import './test-mul.js'
import './test-div.js'

Hope.run()
...
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Here,
<code>all-the-tests.js</code> imports other files so that they will register tests
as a <span class="indexentry" index-key="side effect!for module registration" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#side_effect" markdown="1">side effect</a></span> via calls to <code>hope.test</code>
and then calls <code>Hope.run</code> to execute them.
It works,
but sooner or later (probably sooner) someone will forget to import one of the test files.</p>
<p>A better strategy is to load test files <span class="indexentry" index-key="dynamic loading" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#dynamic_loading" markdown="1">dynamically</a></span>.
While <code>import</code> is usually written as a statement,
it can also be used as an <code>async</code> function
that takes a path as a parameter and loads the corresponding file.
As before,
loading files executes the code they contain,
which registers tests as a side effect:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import minimist from 'minimist'
import glob from 'glob'
import hope from './hope.js'

const main = async (args) =&gt; {
  const options = parse(args)
  if (options.filenames.length === 0) {
    options.filenames = glob.sync(`${options.root}/**/test-*.js`)
  }
  for (const f of options.filenames) {
    await import(f)
  }
  hope.run()
  const result = (options.output === 'terse')
    ? hope.terse()
    : hope.verbose()
  console.log(result)
}


main(process.argv.slice(2))
</code></pre>
<p>By default,
this program finds all files below the current working directory
whose names match the pattern <code>test-*.js</code>
and uses terse output.
Since we may want to look for files somewhere else,
or request verbose output,
the program needs to handle command-line arguments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist"><code>minimist</code></a> module does this
in a way that is consistent with Unix conventions.
Given command-line arguments <em>after</em> the program's name
(i.e., from <code>process.argv[2]</code> onward),
it looks for patterns like <code>-x something</code>
and creates an object with flags as keys and values associated with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Filenames in <code>minimist</code></h3>
<p>If we use a command line like <code>pray.js -v something.js</code>,
then <code>something.js</code> becomes the value of <code>-v</code>.
To indicate that we want <code>something.js</code> added to the list of trailing filenames
associated with the special key <code>_</code> (a single underscore),
we have to write <code>pray.js -v -- something.js</code>.
The double dash is a common Unix convention for signalling the end of parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our <span class="indexentry" index-key="test runner;unit test!test runner" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#test_runner" markdown="1">test runner</a></span> is now complete,
so we can try it out with some files containing tests that pass, fail, and contain errors:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node pray.js -v
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">passes:
  /u/stjs/unit-test/test-add.js::Sum of 1 and 2
  /u/stjs/unit-test/test-sub.js::Difference of 1 and 2
fails:
  /u/stjs/unit-test/test-div.js::Quotient of 1 and 0
  /u/stjs/unit-test/test-mul.js::Product of 1 and 2
errors:
  /u/stjs/unit-test/test-missing.js::Sum of x and 0
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Infinity is allowed</h3>
<p><code>test-div.js</code> contains the line:</p>
<p><code>js
hope.test('Quotient of 1 and 0', () =&gt; assert((1 / 0) === 0))</code></p>
<p>This test counts as a failure rather than an error
because thinks the result of dividing by zero is the special value <code>Infinity</code>
rather than an arithmetic error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loading modules dynamically so that they can register something for us to call later
is a common pattern in many programming languages.
Control flow goes back and forth between the framework and the module being loaded
as this happens
so we must specify the <span class="indexentry" index-key="lifecycle!of unit test;unit test!lifecycle" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#lifecycle" markdown="1">lifecycle</a></span> of the loaded modules quite carefully.
<a class="figref" href="../unit-test/#unit-test-lifecycle">Figure 4.3</a> illustrates what happens
when a pair of files <code>test-add.js</code> and <code>test-sub.js</code> are loaded by our framework:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pray</code> loads <code>hope.js</code>.</li>
<li>Loading <code>hope.js</code> creates a single instance of the class <code>Hope</code>.</li>
<li><code>pray</code> uses <code>glob</code> to find files with tests.</li>
<li><code>pray</code> loads <code>test-add.js</code> using <code>import</code> as a function.</li>
<li>As <code>test-add.js</code> runs, it loads <code>hope.js</code>.
    Since <code>hope.js</code> is already loaded, this does not create a new instance of <code>Hope</code>.</li>
<li><code>test-add.js</code> uses <code>hope.test</code> to register a test (which does not run yet).</li>
<li><code>pray</code> then loads <code>test-sub.js</code>…</li>
<li>…which loads <code>Hope</code>…</li>
<li>…then registers a test.</li>
<li><code>pray</code> can now ask the unique instance of <code>Hope</code> to run all of the tests,
     then get a report from the <code>Hope</code> singleton and display it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="unit-test-exercises">Section 4.5:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">Asynchronous globbing</h3>
<p>Modify <code>pray.js</code> to use the asynchronous version of <code>glob</code> rather than <code>glob.sync</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Timing tests</h3>
<p>Install the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microtime"><code>microtime</code></a> package and then modify the <code>dry-run.js</code> example
so that it records and reports the execution times for tests.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Approximately equal</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a function <code>assertApproxEqual</code> that does nothing if two values are within a certain tolerance of each other
    but throws an exception if they are not:</p>
<pre><code>// throws exception
assertApproxEqual(1.0, 2.0, 0.01, 'Values are too far apart')

// does not throw
assertApproxEqual(1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 'Large margin of error')
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the function so that a default tolerance is used if none is specified:</p>
<pre><code>// throws exception
assertApproxEqual(1.0, 2.0, 'Values are too far apart')

// does not throw
assertApproxEqual(1.0, 2.0, 'Large margin of error', 10.0)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the function again so that it checks the <a class="glossref" href="#relative_error" markdown="1">relative error</a>
    instead of the <a class="glossref" href="#absolute_error" markdown="1">absolute error</a>.
    (The relative error is the absolute value of the difference between the actual and expected value,
    divided by the absolute value.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Rectangle overlay</h3>
<p>A windowing application represents rectangles using objects with four values:
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the coordinates of the lower-left corner,
while <code>w</code> and <code>h</code> are the width and height.
All values are non-negative:
the lower-left corner of the screen is at <code>(0, 0)</code>
and the screen's size is <code>WIDTH</code>x<code>HEIGHT</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write tests to check that an object represents a valid rectangle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The function <code>overlay(a, b)</code> takes two rectangles and returns either
    a new rectangle representing the region where they overlap or <code>null</code> if they do not overlap.
    Write tests to check that <code>overlay</code> is working correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you tests assume that two rectangles that touch on an edge overlap or not?
    What about two rectangles that only touch at a single corner?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Selecting tests</h3>
<p>Modify <code>pray.js</code> so that if the user provides <code>-s pattern</code> or <code>--select pattern</code>
then the program only runs tests in files that contain the string <code>pattern</code> in their name.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Tagging tests</h3>
<p>Modify <code>hope.js</code> so that users can optionally provide an array of strings to tag tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">hope.test('Difference of 1 and 2',
          () =&gt; assert((1 - 2) === -1),
          ['math', 'fast'])
</code></pre>
<p>Then modify <code>pray.js</code> so that if users specify either <code>-t tagName</code> or <code>--tag tagName</code>
only tests with that tag are run.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Mock objects</h3>
<p>A mock object is a simplified replacement for part of a program
whose behavior is easier to control and predict than the thing it is replacing.
For example,
we may want to test that our program does the right thing if an error occurs while reading a file.
To do this,
we write a function that wraps <code>fs.readFileSync</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const mockReadFileSync = (filename, encoding = 'utf-8') =&gt; {
  return fs.readFileSync(filename, encoding)
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and then modify it so that it throws an exception under our control.
For example,
if we define <code>MOCK_READ_FILE_CONTROL</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const MOCK_READ_FILE_CONTROL = [false, false, true, false, true]
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">then the third and fifth calls to <code>mockReadFileSync</code> throw an exception instead of reading data,
as do any calls after the fifth.
Write this function.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Setup and teardown</h3>
<p>Testing frameworks often allow programmers to specify a <code>setup</code> function
that is to be run before each test
and a corresponding <code>teardown</code> function
that is to be run after each test.
(<code>setup</code> usually re-creates complicated test fixtures,
while <code>teardown</code> functions are sometimes needed to clean up after tests,
e.g., to close database connections or delete temporary files.)</p>
<p>Modify the testing framework in this chapter so that
if a file of tests contains something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const createFixtures = () =&gt; {
  ...do something...
}

hope.setup(createFixtures)
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">then the function <code>createFixtures</code> will be called
exactly once before each test in that file.
Add a similar way to register a teardown function with <code>hope.teardown</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise break-before">Multiple tests</h3>
<p>Add a method <code>hope.multiTest</code> that allows users to specify
multiple test cases for a function at once.
For example, this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">hope.multiTest('check all of these`, functionToTest, [
  [['arg1a', 'arg1b'], 'result1'],
  [['arg2a', 'arg2b'], 'result2'],
  [['arg3a', 'arg3b'], 'result3']
])
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">should be equivalent to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">hope.test('check all of these 0',
  () =&gt; assert(functionToTest('arg1a', 'arg1b') === 'result1')
)
hope.test('check all of these 1',
  () =&gt; assert(functionToTest('arg2a', 'arg2b') === 'result2')
)
hope.test('check all of these 2',
  () =&gt; assert(functionToTest('arg3a', 'arg3b') === 'result3')
)
</code></pre>
<h3 class="exercise">Assertions for sets and maps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write functions <code>assertSetEqual</code> and <code>assertMapEqual</code>
    that check whether two instances of <code>Set</code> or two instances of <code>Map</code> are equal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a function <code>assertArraySame</code>
    that checks whether two arrays have the same elements,
    even if those elements are in different orders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Testing promises</h3>
<p>Modify the unit testing framework to handle <code>async</code> functions,
so that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">hope.test('delayed test', async () =&gt; {...})
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">does the right thing.
(Note that you can use <code>typeof</code> to determine whether the object given to <code>hope.test</code>
is a function or a promise.)</p>

<p>Now that we can test software we have something worth saving.
A <span class="indexentry" index-key="version control system" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#version_control_system" markdown="1">version control system</a></span>
like <span class="indexentry" index-key="Git;version control system!Git" markdown="1"><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></span>
keeps track of changes to files
so that we can recover old versions if we want to.
Its heart is a way to archive files that:</p>
<ol>
<li>records which versions of which files existed at the same time
    (so that we can go back to a consistent previous state), and</li>
<li>stores any particular version of a file only once,
    so that we don't waste disk space.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this chapter we will build a tool for doing both tasks.
It won't do everything Git does:
in particular, it won't let us create and merge branches.
If you would like to know how that works,
please see <span class="indexentry" index-key="Cook, Mary Rose" markdown="1"><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook's</a></span> excellent <a href="http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/">Gitlet</a> project.</p>
<h2 id="file-backup-unique">Section 5.1:  How can we uniquely identify files?</h2>
<p>To avoid storing redundant copies of files,
we need a way to tell when two files contain the same data.
We can't rely on names because files can be renamed or moved over time;
we could compare the files byte by byte,
but a quicker way is to use a <span class="indexentry" index-key="hash function" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#hash_function" markdown="1">hash function</a></span>
that turns arbitrary data into a fixed-length string of bits
(<a class="figref" href="../file-backup/#file-backup-hash-function">Figure 5.1</a>).</p>
<figure id="file-backup-hash-function">
<img alt="Hash functions" src="./file-backup/figures/hash-function.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 5.1: How hash functions speed up lookup.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A hash function always produces the same <span class="indexentry" index-key="hash code" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#hash_code" markdown="1">hash code</a></span> for a given input.
A <span class="indexentry" index-key="cryptographic hash function;hash function!cryptographic" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#cryptographic_hash_function" markdown="1">cryptographic hash function</a></span>
has two extra properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The output depends on the entire input:
    changing even a single byte results in a different hash code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outputs look like random numbers:
    they are unpredictable and evenly distributed
    (i.e., the odds of getting any specific hash code are the same)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's easy to write a bad hash function,
but very hard to write one that qualifies as cryptographic.
We will therefore use a library to calculate 160-bit <span class="indexentry" index-key="hash code!SHA-1;SHA-1 hash code" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#sha_1" markdown="1">SHA-1</a></span> hashes for our files.
These are not random enough to keep data secret from a patient, well-funded attacker,
but that's not what we're using them for:
we just want hashes that are random to make <span class="indexentry" index-key="hash function!collision;collision (in hashing)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#collision" markdown="1">collision</a></span> extremely unlikely.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The Birthday Problem</h3>
<p>The odds that two people share a birthday are 1/365 (ignoring February 29).
The odds that they <em>don't</em> are therefore 364/365.
When we add a third person,
the odds that they don't share a birthday with either of the preceding two people are 363/365,
so the overall odds that nobody shares a birthday are (365/365)×(364/365)×(363/365).
If we keep calculating, there's a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday in a group of just 23 people,
and a 99.9% chance with 70 people.</p>
<p>We can use the same math to calculate how many files we need to hash before there's a 50% chance of a collision.
Instead of 365 we use \(2^{160}\) (the number of values that are 160 bits long),
and after checking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#A_simple_exponentiation">Wikipedia</a>
and doing a few calculations with <span class="indexentry" index-key="Wolfram Alpha" markdown="1"><a href="http://wolframalpha.com">Wolfram Alpha</a></span>,
we calculate that we would need to have approximately \(10^{24}\) files
in order to have a 50% chance of a collision.
We're willing to take that risk…</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node's</a> <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html"><code>crypto</code></a> module provides tools to create a SHA-1 hash.
To use them,
we create an object that keeps track of the current state of the hashing calculations,
tell it how we want to encode (or represent) the hash value,
and then feed it some bytes.
When we are done,
we call its <code>.end</code> method
and then use its <code>.read</code> method to get the final result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import crypto from 'crypto'

// create a SHA1 hasher
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha1')

// encode as hex (rather than binary)
hash.setEncoding('hex')

// send it some text
const text = process.argv[2]
hash.write(text)

// signal end of text
hash.end()

// display the result
const sha1sum = hash.read()
console.log(`SHA1 of "${text}" is ${sha1sum}`)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node hash-text.js something

<pre><code class="language-out">SHA1 of "something" is 1af17e73721dbe0c40011b82ed4bb1a7dbe3ce29
</code></pre>
<p>Hashing a file instead of a fixed string is straightforward:
we just read the file's contents and pass those characters to the hashing object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'
import crypto from 'crypto'

const filename = process.argv[2]
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8')

const hash = crypto.createHash('sha1').setEncoding('hex')
hash.write(data)
hash.end()
const sha1sum = hash.read()

console.log(`SHA1 of "${filename}" is ${sha1sum}`)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node hash-file.js hash-file.js

<p>However,
it is more efficient to process the file as a <a class="glossref" href="#stream" markdown="1">stream</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'
import crypto from 'crypto'

const filename = process.argv[2]
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha1').setEncoding('hex')
fs.createReadStream(filename).pipe(hash)
hash.on('finish', () =&gt; {

<p class="continue">This kind of interface is called

because it is designed to process a stream of data one chunk at a time
rather than requiring all of the data to be in memory at once.
Many applications use streams
so that programs don't have to read entire (possibly large) files into memory.</p>
<p>To start,
this program asks the <code>fs</code> library to create a reading stream for a file
and to <a class="glossref" href="#pipe" markdown="1">pipe</a> the data from that stream to the hashing object
(<a class="figref" href="../file-backup/#file-backup-streaming">Figure 5.2</a>).
It then tells the hashing object what to do when there is no more data
by providing a <span class="indexentry" index-key="event handler!streaming API;streaming API!event handler" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#handler" markdown="1">handler</a></span> for the "finish" event.
This is called asynchronously:
as the output shows,
the main program ends before the task handling the end of data is scheduled and run.
Most programs also provide a handler for "data" events to do something with each block of data as it comes in;
the <code>hash</code> object in our program does that for us.</p>

<h2 id="file-backup-backup">Section 5.2:  How can we back up files?</h2>
<p>Many files only change occasionally after they're created, or not at all.
It would be wasteful for a version control system to make copies
each time the user wanted to save a snapshot of a project,
so instead our tool will copy each unique file to something like <code>abcd1234.bck</code>,
where <code>abcd1234</code> is a hash of the file's contents.
It will then store a data structure that records the filenames and hash keys for each snapshot.
The hash keys tell it which unique files are part of the snapshot,
while the filenames tell us what each file's contents were called when the snapshot was made
(since files can be moved or renamed).
To restore a particular snapshot,
all we have to do is copy the saved <code>.bck</code> files back to where they were
(<a class="figref" href="../file-backup/#file-backup-storage">Figure 5.3</a>).</p>

<p>We can build the tools we need to do this using promises (<a class="crossref" href="#async-programming">Chapter 3</a>).
The main function creates a promise that uses the asynchronous version of <code>glob</code> to find files
and then:</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>reads each file into memory; and</p>

<p class="continue">This function uses <code>Promise.all</code>

and use one <code>Promise.all</code> at the end to bring them all together.</p>

<h2 id="file-backup-track">Section 5.3:  How can we track which files have already been backed up?</h2>
<p>The second part of our backup tool keeps track of which files have and haven't been backed up already.
It stores backups in a directory that contains backup files like <code>abcd1234.bck</code>
and files describing the contents of particular snapshots.
The latter are named <code>ssssssssss.csv</code>,
where <code>ssssssssss</code> is the <a class="glossref" href="#utc" markdown="1">UTC</a> <a class="glossref" href="#timestamp" markdown="1">timestamp</a> of the backup's creation
and the <code>.csv</code> extension indicates that the file is formatted as <a class="glossref" href="#csv" markdown="1">comma-separated values</a>.
(We could store these files as <a class="glossref" href="#json" markdown="1">JSON</a>, but CSV is easier for people to read.)</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Time of check/time of use</h3>
<p>Our naming convention for index files will fail if we try to create more than one backup per second.
This might seem very unlikely,
but many faults and security holes are the result of programmers assuming things weren't going to happen.</p>
<p>We could try to avoid this problem by using a two-part naming scheme <code>ssssssss-a.csv</code>,
<code>ssssssss-b.csv</code>, and so on,
but this leads to a <span class="indexentry" index-key="race condition" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#race_condition" markdown="1">race condition</a></span>
called <span class="indexentry" index-key="race condition!time of check/time of use;time of check/time of use" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#toctou" markdown="1">time of check/time of use</a></span>.
If two users run the backup tool at the same time,
they will both see that there isn't a file (yet) with the current timestamp,
so they will both try to create the first one.</p>

<h2 id="file-backup-test">Section 5.4:  How can we test code that modifies files?</h2>
<p>The final thing our tool needs to do
is copy the files that need copying and create a new index file.
The code itself will be relatively simple,
but testing will be complicated by the fact
that our tests will need to create directories and files before they run
and then delete them afterward
(so that they don't contaminate subsequent tests).</p>
<p>A better approach is to use a <span class="indexentry" index-key="mock object!for testing;unit test!using mock object" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#mock_object" markdown="1">mock object</a></span>
instead of the real filesystem.
A mock object has the same interface as the function, object, class, or library that it replaces,
but is designed to be used solely for testing.
Node's <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-fs"><code>mock-fs</code></a> library provides the same functions as the <code>fs</code> library,
but stores everything in memory
(<a class="figref" href="../file-backup/#file-backup-mock-fs">Figure 5.4</a>).
This prevents our tests from accidentally disturbing the filesystem,
and also makes tests much faster
(since in-memory operations are thousands of times faster than operations that touch the disk).</p>

<img alt="Mock filesystem" src="./file-backup/figures/mock-fs.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 5.4: Using a mock filesystem to simplify testing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can create a mock filesystem by giving the library a JSON description of
the files and what they should contain:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'
import mock from 'mock-fs'

import findNew from '../check-existing-files.js'

All of the tests stay exactly the same,
and since <code>mock-fs</code> replaces the functions in the standard <code>fs</code> library with its own,
nothing in our application needs to change either.</p>
<p>We are finally ready to write the program that actually backs up files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs-extra-promise'

import hashExisting from './hash-existing-async.js'
import findNew from './check-existing-files.js'

  const existing = await hashExisting(src)
  const needToCopy = await findNew(dst, existing)
  await copyFiles(dst, needToCopy)
  await saveManifest(dst, timestamp, existing)

<h3 class="exercise">Odds of collision</h3>
<p>If hashes were only 2 bits long,
then the chances of collision with each successive file
assuming no previous collision are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of Files</th>
<th>Odds of Collision</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>25%</td>

<td>3</td>
<td>50%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>75%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>100%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A colleague of yours says this means that if we hash four files,
there's only a 75% chance of any collision occurring.
What are the actual odds?</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Streaming I/O</h3>
<p>Write a small program using <code>fs.createReadStream</code> and <code>fs.createWriteStream</code>
that copies a file piece by piece
instead of reading it into memory and then writing it out again.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Sequencing backups</h3>
<p>Modify the backup program so that manifests are numbered sequentially
as <code>00000001.csv</code>, <code>00000002.csv</code>, and so on
rather than being timestamped.
Why doesn't this solve the time of check/time of use race condition mentioned earlier.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">JSON manifests</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify <code>backup.js</code> so that it can save JSON manifests as well as CSV manifests
    based on a command-line flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write another program called <code>migrate.js</code> that converts a set of manifests
    from CSV to JSON.
    (The program's name comes from the term <a class="glossref" href="#data_migration" markdown="1">data migration</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify <code>backup.js</code> programs so that each manifest stores the user name of the person who created it
    along with file hashes,
    and then modify <code>migrate.js</code> to transform old files into the new format.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Mock hashes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the file backup program so that it uses a function called <code>ourHash</code> to hash files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a replacement that returns some predictable value, such as the first few characters of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewrite the tests to use this function.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How did you modify the main program so that the tests could control which hashing function is used?</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Comparing manifests</h3>
<p>Write a program <code>compare-manifests.js</code> that reads two manifest files and reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which files have the same names but different hashes
    (i.e., their contents have changed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which files have the same hashes but different names
    (i.e., they have been renamed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which files are in the first hash but neither their names nor their hashes are in the second
    (i.e., they have been deleted).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which files are in the second hash but neither their names nor their hashes are in the first
    (i.e., they have been added).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="exercise">From one state to another</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a program called <code>from-to.js</code> that takes the name of a directory
    and the name of a manifest file
    as its command-line arguments,
    then adds, removes, and/or renames files in the directory
    to restore the state described in the manifest.
    The program should only perform file operations when it needs to,
    e.g.,
    it should not delete a file and re-add it if the contents have not changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write some tests for <code>from-to.js</code> using Mocha and <code>mock-fs</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">File history</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a program called <code>file-history.js</code>
    that takes the name of a file as a command-line argument
    and displays the history of that file
    by tracing it back in time through the available manifests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write tests for your program using Mocha and <code>mock-fs</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Pre-commit hooks</h3>
<p>Modify <code>backup.js</code> to load and run a function called <code>preCommit</code> from a file called <code>pre-commit.js</code>
stored in the root directory of the files being backed up.
If <code>preCommit</code> returns <code>true</code>, the backup proceeds;
if it returns <code>false</code> or throws an exception,
no backup is created.</p>

but what about different in-memory operations---how do they compare with each other?
Putting it another way,
how can we tell which of several designs is going to be the most efficient?</p>
<p>The best answer is to conduct some <span class="indexentry" index-key="experiments" markdown="1">experiments</span>.
To see how to do this,
we will take a look at several ways to implement data tables
with one or more named columns and zero or more rows.
Each row has one value for each column,
and all the values in a column have the same type
(<a class="figref" href="../data-table/#data-table-conceptual">Figure 6.1</a>).
Data tables appear over and over again in programming,
from spreadsheets and databases
to the <span class="indexentry" index-key="data frame" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#data_frame" markdown="1">data frames</a></span> in
<span class="indexentry" index-key="R" markdown="1">R's</span> <span class="indexentry" index-key="tidyverse" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a></span> packages,
<span class="indexentry" index-key="Python" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python's</a></span> <span class="indexentry" index-key="Pandas" markdown="1"><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></span> library,
or the <span class="indexentry" index-key="DataForge" markdown="1"><a href="http://www.data-forge-js.com/">DataForge</a></span> library for JavaScript <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Davis2018">Davis2018</a></span>.</p>
<figure id="data-table-conceptual">
<img alt="Data table structure" src="./data-table/figures/conceptual.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 6.1: The structure of a data table.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The key operations on data tables are those provided by <span class="indexentry" index-key="SQL" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#sql" markdown="1">SQL</a></span>:
filter, select, summarize, and join.
These can be implemented in about five hundred lines of code,
but their performance depends on how the data table is stored.</p>
<h2 id="data-table-implement">Section 6.1:  How can we implement data tables?</h2>
<p>One way to store a table is <span class="indexentry" index-key="row-major storage order;storage order!row-major" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#row_major" markdown="1">row-major</a></span> order,
in which the values in each row are stored together in memory.
This is sometimes also called <span class="indexentry" index-key="heterogeneous storage;storage!heterogeneous" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#heterogeneous" markdown="1">heterogeneous</a></span> storage
because each "unit" of storage can contain values of different types.
We can implement this design in JavaScript using an array of objects,
each of which has the same keys
(<a class="figref" href="../data-table/#data-table-storage-order">Figure 6.2</a>).</p>
<p>Another option is <span class="indexentry" index-key="column-major storage order;storage order!column-major" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#column_major" markdown="1">column-major</a></span>
or <span class="indexentry" index-key="homogeneous storage;storage!homogeneous" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#homogeneous" markdown="1">homogeneous</a></span> order,
in which all the values in a column are stored together.
In JavaScript,
this could be implemented using an object
whose members are all arrays of the same length.</p>
<figure id="data-table-storage-order">
<img alt="Row-major vs. column-major storage order" src="./data-table/figures/storage-order.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 6.2: Row-major storage vs. column-major storage for data tables.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To find out which is better
we will construct one of each,
try some operations,
record their execution times and memory use,
and then compare them.
Crucially,
the answer will depend on both the implementations themselves
and on what mix of operations we measure.
For example,
if one strategy works better for filter and another for select,
the ratio of filters to selects may determine which is "best".</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Immutability</h3>
<p>All of our implementations will treat each data table as <span class="indexentry" index-key="immutable data" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#immutable" markdown="1">immutable</a></span>:
once we have created it,
we will not modify its contents.
This doesn't actually have much impact on performance
an makes the programming easier and safer,
since shared data structures are a rich source of bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our first experiment,
let's build a row-major table with some number of columns.
To keep it simple,
we will repeat the values 0, 1, and 2 to fill the table.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const buildRows = (nRows, labels) =&gt; {
  const result = []
  for (let iR = 0; iR &lt; nRows; iR += 1) {
    const row = {}
    labels.forEach(label =&gt; {
      row[label] = iR
    })
    result.push(row)
  }
  return result
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next,
we write <code>filter</code> and <code>select</code> for tables laid out this way.
We need to provide a callback function to <code>filter</code> to determine which rows to keep
like the callback for <code>Array.filter</code>;
for selecting columns,
we provide a list of the keys that identify the columns we want to keep.
We expect filtering to be relatively fast,
since it is <span class="indexentry" index-key="recycling data" markdown="1">recycling</span> rows,
while selecting should be relatively slow because we have to construct a new set of arrays
(<a class="figref" href="../data-table/#data-table-row-ops">Figure 6.3</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const rowFilter = (table, func) =&gt; {
  return table.filter(row =&gt; func(row))
}

const rowSelect = (table, toKeep) =&gt; {
  return table.map(row =&gt; {
    const newRow = {}
    toKeep.forEach(label =&gt; {
      newRow[label] = row[label]
    })
    return newRow
  })
}
</code></pre>
<figure id="data-table-row-ops">
<img alt="Row-major operations" src="./data-table/figures/row-ops.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 6.3: Operations on row-major data tables.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now let's do the same for column-major storage.
Building the object that holds the columns is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const buildCols = (nRows, labels) =&gt; {
  const result = {}
  labels.forEach(label =&gt; {
    result[label] = []
    for (let iR = 0; iR &lt; nRows; iR += 1) {
      result[label].push(iR)
    }
  })
  return result
}
</code></pre>
<p>Filtering is more complex because the values in each row are scattered across several arrays,
but selecting is just a matter of recycling the arrays we want in the new table.
We expect selecting to be relatively fast,
since only the references to the columns need to be copied,
but filtering will be relatively slow since we are constructing multiple new arrays
(<a class="figref" href="../data-table/#data-table-col-ops">Figure 6.4</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const colFilter = (table, func) =&gt; {
  const result = {}
  const labels = Object.keys(result)
  labels.forEach(label =&gt; {
    result[label] = []
  })
  for (let iR = 0; iR &lt; table.label_1.length; iR += 1) {
    if (func(table, iR)) {
      labels.forEach(label =&gt; {
        result[label].push(table[label][iR])
      })
    }
  }
  return result
}

const colSelect = (table, toKeep) =&gt; {
  const result = {}
  toKeep.forEach(label =&gt; {
    result[label] = table[label]
  })
  return result
}
</code></pre>
<figure id="data-table-col-ops">
<img alt="Column-major operations" src="./data-table/figures/col-ops.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 6.4: Operations on column-major data tables.</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<h3>Not quite polymorphic</h3>
<p>Our tests would be simpler to write if the two versions of <code>filter</code> and <code>select</code>
took exactly the same parameters,
but the row-testing functions for <code>filter</code> are different
because of the differences in the ways the tables are stored.
We could force them to be the same by (for example)
packing the values for each row in the column-major implementation
into a temporary object
and passing that to the same filtering function we used for the row-major implementation,
but that extra work would bias the performance comparison in row-major's favor.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="data-table-profile">Section 6.2:  How can we test the performance of our implementations?</h2>
<p>Now that we have our tables and operations,
we can build a <span class="indexentry" index-key="test harness;experiments!test harness" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#test_harness" markdown="1">test harness</a></span> to run those operations
on data tables of varying sizes.
We arbitrarily decide to keep half of the columns and one-third of the rows;
these ratios will affect our decision about which is better,
so if we were doing this for a real application we would test what happens
as these fractions vary.
And as we said earlier,
the relative performance will also depend on the how many filters we do for each select;
our balance should be based on data from whatever application we intend to support.</p>
<p>Our performance measurement program looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const RANGE = 3

const main = () =&gt; {
  const nRows = parseInt(process.argv[2])
  const nCols = parseInt(process.argv[3])
  const filterPerSelect = parseFloat(process.argv[4])

  const labels = [...Array(nCols).keys()].map(i =&gt; `label_${i + 1}`)
  const someLabels = labels.slice(0, Math.floor(labels.length / 2))
  assert(someLabels.length &gt; 0,
    'Must have some labels for select (array too short)')

  const [rowTable, rowSize, rowHeap] = memory(buildRows, nRows, labels)
  const [colTable, colSize, colHeap] = memory(buildCols, nRows, labels)

  const rowFilterTime =
    time(rowFilter, rowTable,
      row =&gt; ((row.label_1 % RANGE) === 0))
  const rowSelectTime =
    time(rowSelect, rowTable, someLabels)
  const colFilterTime =
    time(colFilter, colTable,
      (table, iR) =&gt; ((table.label_1[iR] % RANGE) === 0))
  const colSelectTime =
    time(colSelect, colTable, someLabels)

  const ratio = calculateRatio(filterPerSelect,
    rowFilterTime, rowSelectTime,
    colFilterTime, colSelectTime)

  const result = {
    nRows,
    nCols,
    filterPerSelect,
    rowSize,

    rowFilterTime,
    rowSelectTime,
    colFilterTime,
    colSelectTime,
    ratio
  }
  console.log(yaml.safeDump(result))
}
</code></pre>
<p>The functions that actually do the measurements
use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microtime"><code>microtime</code></a> library to get microsecond level timing
because JavaScript's <code>Date</code> only gives us millisecond-level resolution.
We use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-sizeof"><code>object-sizeof</code></a> to estimate memory how much memory our structures require;
we also call <code>process.memoryUsage()</code> and look at the <code>heapUsed</code> value
to see how much memory <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> is using while the program runs,
but that may be affected by <a class="glossref" href="#garbage_collection" markdown="1">garbage collection</a>
and a host of other factors outside our control.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const memory = (func, ...params) =&gt; {
  const before = process.memoryUsage()

  return [result, size, heap]
}

const time = (func, ...params) =&gt; {
  const before = microtime.now()
  func(...params)
  const after = microtime.now()
  return after - before

const calculateRatio = (f2S, rFilterT, rSelectT, cFilterT, cSelectT) =&gt; {
  return ((f2S * rFilterT) + rSelectT) / ((f2S * cFilterT) + cSelectT)
}

<p>Let's run our program for a table with 100 rows and 3 columns and a 3:1 ratio of filter to select:</p>

</div>
<p>The results in <a class="tblref" href="../data-table/#data-table-performance">Table 6.1</a> show that column-major storage is better.
It uses less memory (presumably because column labels aren't duplicated once per row)
and the time required to construct new objects when doing select with row-major storage
outweighs cost of appending to arrays when doing filter with column-major storage.
Unfortunately,
the code for column-major storage is a little more complicated to write,
which is a cost that doesn't show up in experiments.</p>
<h2 id="data-table-save">Section 6.3:  What is the most efficient way to save a table?</h2>
<p>Data is valuable,
so we are going to store data tables in files of some kind.
If one storage scheme is much more efficient than another and we are reading or writing frequently,
that could change our mind about which implementation to pick.</p>
<p>Two simple text-based schemes are row-oriented and column-oriented <a class="glossref" href="#json" markdown="1">JSON</a>---basically,
just printing the data structures we have.
Let's run the 10,000×30 test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">nRows: 10000
nCols: 30
rowStringTime: 57342
rowStringSize: 9393402
colStringTime: 13267
colStringSize: 2934164
</code></pre>
<p>The time needed for the row-major version is almost ten times greater than
that needed for the column-major version;
we assume that the redundant printing of the labels is mostly to blame,
just as redundant storage of the labels was to blame for row-major's greater memory requirements.</p>
<p>If that diagnosis is correct,
then a packed version of row-major storage ought to be faster.
We save the column headers once,
then copy the data values into an array of arrays and save that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const asPackedJson = (table) =&gt; {
  const temp = {}
  temp.keys = Object.keys(table[0])
  temp.values = table.map(row =&gt; temp.keys.map(k =&gt; row[k]))
  return JSON.stringify(temp)
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">nRows: 10000
nCols: 30
packedRowStringTime: 29659
packedRowStringSize: 2974084
</code></pre>
<p>These results show that changing layout for storage
is faster than turning the data structure we have into a string.
Again,
we assume this is because copying data takes less time than turning labels into strings over and over,
but column-major storage is still the best approach.</p>
<h2 id="data-table-binary">Section 6.4:  Does binary storage improve performance?</h2>
<p>Let's try one more strategy for storing our tables.
JavaScript stores values in <span class="indexentry" index-key="tagged data structure" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#tagged_data" markdown="1">tagged</a></span> data structures:
some bits define the value's type
while other bits store the value itself in a type-dependent way
(<a class="figref" href="../data-table/#data-table-object-storage">Figure 6.5</a>).</p>
<figure id="data-table-object-storage">
<img alt="JavaScript object storage" src="./data-table/figures/object-storage.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 6.5: How JavaScript uses tagged data structures to store objects.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can save space by keeping track of the types ourselves
and just storing the bits that represent the values.
JavaScript has an <span class="indexentry" index-key="ArrayBuffer" markdown="1"><code>ArrayBuffer</code></span> class for exactly this purpose.
It stores any value we want as a set of bits;
we then access those bits through a view that presents the data as a particular type,
such as Boolean (one byte per value) or number (64 bits per number).
As <a class="figref" href="../data-table/#data-table-packed-storage">Figure 6.6</a> shows,
we can mix different types of data in a single <code>ArrayBuffer</code>,
but it's up to us to keep track of which bytes belong to which values.</p>
<figure id="data-table-packed-storage">
<img alt="Packing objects for storage" src="./data-table/figures/packed-storage.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 6.6: Storing object values as bits with lookup information.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To store a column-major table we will fill an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> with:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two integers that hold the table's size (number of rows and number of columns).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A string with the column labels joined by newline characters.
    (We use newlines as a separator because we assume column labels can't contain them.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The numbers themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-js">const asBinary = (table) =&gt; {
  const labels = Object.keys(table)

  const allLabels = labels.join('\n')
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  const encodedLabels = encoder.encode(allLabels)

  const totalSize =
    dimensions.byteLength + encodedLabels.byteLength + dataSize

  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(totalSize)
  const result = new Uint8Array(buffer)
  result.set(dimensions, 0)
  result.set(encodedLabels, dimensions.byteLength)

  let current = dimensions.byteLength + encodedLabels.byteLength
  labels.forEach(label =&gt; {
    const temp = new Float64Array(table[label])
    result.set(temp, current)
    current += temp.byteLength
  })

  return result
}

<pre><code class="language-out">nRows: 10000
nCols: 30
packedColBinaryTime: 6074
packedColBinarySize: 2400268
</code></pre>
<p>Packing the data table saves time
because copying bits is faster than turning numbers into characters,
but it doesn't save as much space as expected.
The reason is that double-precision numbers are 8 bytes long,
but because we have chosen simple integer values for our tests,
they can be represented by just 5 characters (which is 10 bytes).
If we had "real" numbers the storage benefit would probably be more pronounced;
once again,
the result of our experiment depends on the test cases we choose.</p>

<p>Write a test to compare the performance of row-wise vs. column-wise storage

<h3 class="exercise">Join optimization</h3>
<p>The simplest way to <a class="glossref" href="#join" markdown="1">join</a> two tables is
to look for matching keys using a double loop.
An alternative is to build an <a class="glossref" href="#index_database" markdown="1">index</a> for each table

<p>The first step is to create a <code>Map</code> showing where each key is found in the first table:</p>

and construct all of the matches.</p>
<p>Write a function that joins two tables this way.
Is it faster or slower than using a double loop?
How does the answer depend on the number of keys and the fraction that match?</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Flipping storage</h3>
<p>Our tests showed that storing row-oriented tables as JSON
is much slower than storing column-oriented tables.
Write a test to determine whether converting a row-oriented table to a column-oriented table
and then saving the latter
is faster than saving the row-oriented table directly.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Sparse storage</h3>
<p>A <a class="glossref" href="#sparse_matrix" markdown="1">sparse matrix</a> is one in which most of the values are zero.
Instead of storing them all,
a program can use a map to store non-zero values
and a lookup function to return zero for anything that isn't stored explicitly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">def spareMatrixGet(matrix, row, col) =&gt; {
  return matrix.contains(row, col)
    ? matrix.get(row, col)
    : 0
}
</code></pre>
<p>The same technique can be used if most of the entries in a data table are missing.
Write a function that creates a sparse table in which a random 5% of the values are non-zero
and the other 95% are zero,
then compare the memory requirements and performance of filter and select for this implementation
versus those of row-wise and column-wise storage.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Loading time</h3>
<p>Modify the programs in this section to measure the time required to convert a data table from JSON or binary form
back to a data structure.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Saving fixed-width strings</h3>
<p>To improve performance,
databases often store <a class="glossref" href="#fixed_width_string" markdown="1">fixed-width</a> strings,
i.e.,
they limit the length of the strings in a column to some fixed size
and <a class="glossref" href="#pad_string" markdown="1">pad</a> strings that are shorter than that.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a function that takes an array of strings and an integer with
    and creates an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> containing the strings padded to that width.
    The function should throw an exception if any of the strings
    are longer than the specified width.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write another function that takes an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> as input
    and returns an array of strings.
    This function should remove the padding
    so that strings shorter than the fixed width are restored to their original form.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Saving variable-width strings</h3>
<p><a class="glossref" href="#fixed_width_string" markdown="1">Fixed-width</a> storage is inefficient for large blocks of text
such as contracts, novels, and resumés,
since padding every document to the length of the longest will probably waste a lot of space.
An alternative way to store these in binary is to save each entry as a (length, text) pair.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a function that takes a list of strings as input
    and returns an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> containing (length, text) pairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write another function that takes such an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>
    and returns an array containing the original text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write tests with Mocha to confirm that your functions work correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">ASCII storage</h3>
<p>The original ASCII standard specified
a 7-bit <a class="glossref" href="#character_encoding" markdown="1">character encoding</a> for letters commonly used in English,
and many data files still only use characters whose numeric codes are in the range 0--127.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a function that takes an array of single-letter strings
    and returns an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> that stores them using one byte per character
    if all of the characters will fit into 7 bits,
    and multiple bytes per character if any of the characters require more than 7 bits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write another function that takes an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> generated by the first function
    and re-creates the array of characters.
    The function must <em>only</em> take the <code>ArrayBuffer</code> as an argument,
    so the first element of the <code>ArrayBuffer</code> should indicate
    how to interpret the rest of its contents.</p>

<p>We have been globbing to match filenames against patterns since <a class="crossref" href="#systems-programming">Chapter 2</a>.
This lesson will explore how that works
by building a simple version of the <span class="indexentry" index-key="regular expression" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#regular_expression" markdown="1">regular expressions</a></span>
used to match text in everything from editor and shell commands to web scrapers.
Our approach is inspired by <span class="indexentry" index-key="Kernighan, Brian" markdown="1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan's</a></span> entry
in <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Oram2007">Oram2007</a></span>.</p>
<p>Regular expressions have inspired pattern matching for many other kinds of data,
such as <span class="indexentry" index-key="query selector (for HTML)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#query_selector" markdown="1">query selectors</a></span> for HTML.
They are easier to understand and implement than patterns for matching text,
so we will start by looking at them.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching-selectors">Section 7.1:  How can we match query selectors?</h2>
<p>Programs stores HTML pages in memory using a <span class="indexentry" index-key="DOM;Document Object Model" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#dom" markdown="1">document object model</a></span> or DOM.
Each element in the page,
such as a heading and or paragraph,
is a <a class="glossref" href="#node" markdown="1">nodes</a>;
the <a class="glossref" href="#child_tree" markdown="1">children</a> of a node are the elements it contains

<p>According to this grammar,
<code>blockquote#important p.highlight</code> is a highlighted paragraph inside the blockquote whose ID is <code>"important"</code>.
To find elements in a page that match it,
our <code>select</code> function breaks the query into pieces
and uses <code>firstMatch</code> to search recursively down the document tree
until all the selectors in the query string have matched or no matches have been found
(<a class="figref" href="../pattern-matching/#pattern-matching-query-selectors">Figure 7.2</a>).</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

const select = (root, selector) =&gt; {
  const selectors = selector.split(' ').filter(s =&gt; s.length &gt; 0)
  return firstMatch(root, selectors)
}

const firstMatch = (node, selectors) =&gt; {
  assert(selectors.length &gt; 0,
    'Require selector(s)')

  // Not a tag.

  // This node doesn't match, so try further down.
  return firstChildMatch(node, selectors)
}


export default select
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>firstMatch</code> function handles three cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This node isn't an element, i.e., it is plain text or a comment.
    This can't match a selector, and these nodes don't have children,
    so the function returns <code>null</code> to indicate that matching has failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This node matches the current selector.
    If there aren't any selectors left then the whole pattern must have matched,
    so the function returns this node as the match.
    If there <em>are</em> more selectors,
    we try to match those that remain against this node's children
    and return whatever result that produces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This node <em>doesn't</em> match the current selector,
    so we search the children one by one to see if there is a match further down.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This algorithm is called <span class="indexentry" index-key="depth-first search;search!depth-first" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#depth_first" markdown="1">depth-first search</a></span>:
it explores one possible match to the end before considering any others.
<code>firstMatch</code> relies on a helper function called <code>firstChildMatch</code>,
which finds the first child of a node to match a set of selectors:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const firstChildMatch = (node, selectors) =&gt; {
  assert(node.type === 'tag',
    `Should only try to match first child of tags, not ${node.type}`)

  // First working match.
  for (const child of node.children) {
    const match = firstMatch(child, selectors)
    if (match) {
      return match
    }
  }

  // Nothing worked.
  return null
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and on the function <code>matchHere</code> which compares a node against a selector:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const matchHere = (node, selector) =&gt; {
  let name = null
  let id = null
  let cls = null
  if (selector.includes('#')) {
    [name, id] = selector.split('#')
  } else if (selector.includes('.')) {
    [name, cls] = selector.split('.')
  } else {
    name = selector
  }
  return (node.name === name) &amp;&amp;
    ((id === null) || (node.attribs.id === id)) &amp;&amp;
    ((cls === null) || (node.attribs.class === cls))
}
</code></pre>
<p>This version of <code>matchHere</code> is simple but inefficient,
since it breaks the selector into parts each time it is called
rather than doing that once and re-using the results.
We will build a more efficient version in the exercises,
but let's try out the one we have.
Our test cases are all in one piece of HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const HTML = `&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;text of first p&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p id="id-01"&gt;text of p#id-01&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p id="id-02"&gt;text of p#id-02&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="class-03"&gt;text of p.class-03&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;text of div / p&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="id-04"&gt;text of div / p#id-04&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="class-05"&gt;text of div / p.class-05&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="class-06"&gt;should not be found&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="id-07"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;text of div#id-07 / p&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="class-06"&gt;text of div#id-07 / p.class-06&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;`
</code></pre>
<p>The program contains a table of queries and the expected matches.
The function <code>main</code> loops over it to report whether each test passes or fails:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = () =&gt; {
  const doc = htmlparser2.parseDOM(HTML)[0]
  const tests = [
    ['p', 'text of first p'],

    ['div p.class-05', 'text of div / p.class-05'],
    ['div#id-07 p', 'text of div#id-07 / p'],
    ['div#id-07 p.class-06', 'text of div#id-07 / p.class-06']
  ]
  tests.forEach(([selector, expected]) =&gt; {
    const node = select(doc, selector)
    const actual = getText(node)
    const result = (actual === expected) ? 'pass' : 'fail'
    console.log(`"${selector}": ${result}`)
  })
}

main()
</code></pre>
<p class="continue"><code>main</code> uses a helper function called <code>getText</code> to extract text from a node
or return an error message if something has gone wrong:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const getText = (node) =&gt; {
  if (!node) {
    return 'MISSING NODE'
  }
  if (!('children' in node)) {
    return 'MISSING CHILDREN'
  }
  if (node.children.length !== 1) {
    return 'WRONG NUMBER OF CHILDREN'
  }
  if (node.children[0].type !== 'text') {
    return 'NOT TEXT'
  }
  return node.children[0].data
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run our program it produces this result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">"p": pass
"p#id-01": pass
"p#id-02": pass
"p.class-03": pass
"div p": pass
"div p#id-04": pass
"div p.class-05": pass
"div#id-07 p": pass
"div#id-07 p.class-06": pass

<h2 id="pattern-matching-re">Section 7.2:  How can we implement a simple regular expression matcher?</h2>
<p>Matching regular expressions against text relies on the same recursive strategy
as matching query selectors against nodes in an HTML page.
If the first element of the pattern matches where we are,
we see if the rest of the pattern matches what's left;
otherwise,
we see if the the pattern will match further along.
Our matcher will initially handle just the five cases shown in
<a class="tblref" href="../pattern-matching/#pattern-matching-cases">Table 7.2</a>.</p>
<div class="table"><table id="pattern-matching-cases"><caption>Table 7.2: Pattern matching cases.</caption>

<p class="continue">These five cases are a small subset of what JavaScript provides,
but as <span class="indexentry" index-key="Kernighan, Brian" markdown="1">Kernighan</span> wrote,
"This is quite a useful class;
in my own experience of using regular expressions on a day-to-day basis,
it easily accounts for 95 percent of all instances."</p>
<p>The top-level function that users call
handles the special case of <code>^</code> at the start of a pattern
matching the start of the target string being searched.
It then tries the pattern against each successive substring of the target string
until it finds a match or runs out of characters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const match = (pattern, text) =&gt; {
  // '^' at start of pattern matches start of text.
  if (pattern[0] === '^') {
    return matchHere(pattern, 1, text, 0)
  }

  // Try all possible starting points for pattern.
  let iText = 0
  do {
    if (matchHere(pattern, 0, text, iText)) {
      return true
    }
    iText += 1
  } while (iText &lt; text.length)

  // Nothing worked.
  return false
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>matchHere</code> does the matching and recursing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const matchHere = (pattern, iPattern, text, iText) =&gt; {
  // There is no more pattern to match.
  if (iPattern === pattern.length) {
    return true
  }

  // '$' at end of pattern matches end of text.
  if ((iPattern === (pattern.length - 1)) &amp;&amp;
      (pattern[iPattern] === '$') &amp;&amp;
      (iText === text.length)) {
    return true
  }

  // '*' following current character means match many.
  if (((pattern.length - iPattern) &gt; 1) &amp;&amp;
      (pattern[iPattern + 1] === '*')) {
    while ((iText &lt; text.length) &amp;&amp; (text[iText] === pattern[iPattern])) {
      iText += 1
    }
    return matchHere(pattern, iPattern + 2, text, iText)
  }

  // Match a single character.
  if ((pattern[iPattern] === '.') ||
      (pattern[iPattern] === text[iText])) {
    return matchHere(pattern, iPattern + 1, text, iText + 1)
  }

  // Nothing worked.
  return false
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once again,
we use a table of test cases and expected results to test it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = () =&gt; {

  ]
  tests.forEach(([regexp, text, expected]) =&gt; {
    const actual = match(regexp, text)
    const result = (actual === expected) ? 'pass' : 'fail'
    console.log(`"${regexp}" X "${text}": ${result}`)

</code></pre>
<p>This program seems to work,
but it actually contains an error that we will correct in the exercises.
(Think about what happens if we match the pattern <code>/a*ab/</code> against the string <code>'aab'</code>.)
Our design is also hard to extend:
handling parentheses in patterns like <code>/a(bc)*d/</code> will require major changes.
We need to explore a different approach.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching-extensible">Section 7.3:  How can we implement an extensible matcher?</h2>
<p>Instead of packing all of our code into one long function,
we can implement each kind of match as separate function.
Doing this makes it much easier to add more matchers:
we just define a function that we can mix in with calls to the ones we already have.</p>
<p>Rather than having these functions do the matching immediately,
though,
we will have each one return an object that knows how to match itself against some text.
Doing this allows us to build a complex match once and re-use it many times.
This is a common pattern in text processing:
we may want to apply a regular expression to each line in a large set of files,
so recycling the matchers will make our programs more efficient.</p>
<p>Each matching object has a method that takes the target string and the index to start matching at as inputs.
Its output is the index to continue matching at
or <code>undefined</code> indicating that matching failed.
We can then combine these objects to match complex patterns
(<a class="figref" href="../pattern-matching/#pattern-matching-regex-objects">Figure 7.3</a>).</p>

<img alt="Implementing regex with objects" src="./pattern-matching/figures/regex-objects.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 7.3: Using nested objects to match regular expressions.</figcaption>

<p>The first step in implementing this is to write test cases,
which forces us to define the syntax we are going to support:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Alt from './regex-alt.js'

<p>Next,
we define a <a class="glossref" href="#base_class" markdown="1">base class</a> that all matchers will inherit from.

  _match (text, start) {
    throw new Error('derived classes must override "_match"')

<p class="continue">The base class also defines a <code>_match</code> method (with a leading underscore)

<p>We can now define empty versions of each matching class that all say "no match here"
like this one for literal characters:</p>

<p class="continue">This output tells us how much work we have left to do:
when all of these tests pass,

<p>We will tackle <code>RegexSeq</code> next so that we can combine other matchers.
This is why we have tests for <code>Seq(Lit('a'), Lit('b'))</code> and <code>Lit('ab')</code>:
all children have to match in order without gaps.</p>
<p>But wait:
suppose we have the pattern <code>/a*ab/</code>.
This ought to match the text <code>"ab"</code>, but will it?
The <code>/*/</code> is <span class="indexentry" index-key="greedy algorithm;algorithm!greedy" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#greedy_algorithm" markdown="1">greedy</a></span>: it matches as much as it can
(which is also called <span class="indexentry" index-key="eager matching;matching!eager" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#eager_matching" markdown="1">eager matching</a></span>).
As a result,
<code>/a*/</code> will match the leading <code>"a"</code>, leaving nothing for the literal <code>/a/</code> to match
(<a class="figref" href="../pattern-matching/#pattern-matching-greedy-failure">Figure 7.4</a>).
Our current implementation doesn't give us a way to try other possible matches when this happens.</p>

<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 7.4: Why overly-greedy matching doesn't work.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let's re-think our design
and have each matcher take its own arguments and a <code>rest</code> parameter containing the rest of the matchers
(<a class="figref" href="../pattern-matching/#pattern-matching-rest">Figure 7.5</a>).
(We will provide a default of <code>null</code> in the creation function
so we don't have to type <code>null</code> over and over again.)
Each matcher will try each of its possibilities and then see if the rest will also match.</p>

<p>Here's how this works for matching a literal expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import RegexBase from './regex-base.js'

class RegexLit extends RegexBase {
  constructor (chars, rest) {
    super(rest)
    this.chars = chars
  }

    const nextIndex = start + this.chars.length
    if (nextIndex &gt; text.length) {

export default (chars, rest = null) =&gt; new RegexLit(chars, rest)
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The <code>_match</code> method checks whether all of the pattern matches the target text starting at the current location.
If so, it checks whether the rest of the overall pattern matches what's left.
Matching the start <code>/^/</code> and end <code>/$/</code> anchors is just as straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import RegexBase from './regex-base.js'

class RegexStart extends RegexBase {
  _match (text, start) {
    if (start !== 0) {
      return undefined

    return this.rest._match(text, start)
  }
}

export default (rest = null) =&gt; new RegexEnd(rest)

<p>Matching either/or is done by trying the first pattern and the rest,
and if that fails,
trying the second pattern and the rest:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import RegexBase from './regex-base.js'

class RegexAlt extends RegexBase {
  constructor (left, right, rest) {
    super(rest)
    this.left = left

}

const create = (left, right, rest = null) =&gt; {
  return new RegexAlt(left, right, rest)
}

export default create
</code></pre>
<p>To match a repetition,
we figure out the maximum number of matches that might be left,
then count down until something succeeds.
(We start with the maximum because matching is supposed to be greedy.)
Each non-empty repetition matches at least one character,
so the number of remaining characters is the maximum number of matches worth trying.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import RegexBase from './regex-base.js'

our tests all pass:</p>

<p>The most important thing about this design is how extensible it is:
if we want to add other kinds of matching,
all we have to do is add more classes.
That extensibility comes from the lack of centralized decision-making,
which in turn comes from our use of polymorphism
and the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Chain of Responsibility pattern;design pattern!Chain of Responsibility" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#chain_of_responsibility_pattern" markdown="1">Chain of Responsibility</a></span> design pattern.
Each component does its part and asks something else to handle the remaining work;
so long as each component takes the same inputs,
we can put them together however we want.</p>

<h3>The Open-Closed Principle</h3>
<p>The <span class="indexentry" index-key="Open-Closed Principle;software design!Open-Closed Principle" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#open_closed_principle" markdown="1">Open-Closed Principle</a></span> states that
software should be open for extension but closed for modification,
i.e., that it should be possible to extend functionality
without having to rewrite existing code.
As we said in <a class="crossref" href="#async-programming">Chapter 3</a>,
this allows old code to use new code,
but only if our design permits the kinds of extensions people are going to want to make.
Since we can't anticipate everything,
it is normal to have to revise a design the first two or three times we try to extend it.

<h3 class="exercise">Split once</h3>
<p>Modify the query selector code so that selectors like <code>div#id</code> and <code>div.class</code> are only split into pieces once
rather than being re-split each time <code>matchHere</code> is called.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Find and fix the error</h3>
<p>The first regular expression matcher contains an error:
the pattern <code>'a*ab'</code> should match the string <code>'aab'</code> but doesn't.
Figure out why it fails and fix it.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Unit tests</h3>
<p>Rewrite the tests for selectors and regular expressions to use Mocha.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Find all with query selectors</h3>
<p>Modify the query selector so that it returns <em>all</em> matches, not just the first one.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Select based on attributes</h3>
<p>Modify the query selector to handle <code>[attribute="value"]</code> selectors,
so that (for example) <code>div[align=center]</code> returns all <code>div</code> elements
whose <code>align</code> attribute has the value <code>"center"</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Child selectors</h3>
<p>The expression <code>parent &gt; child</code> selects all nodes of type <code>child</code>
that are immediate children of nodes of type <code>parent</code>---for example,
<code>div &gt; p</code> selects all paragraphs that are immediate children of <code>div</code> elements.
Modify <code>simple-selectors.js</code> to handle this kind of matching.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Find all with regular expressions</h3>
<p>Modify the regular expression matcher to return <em>all</em> matches rather than just the first one.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Find one or more with regular expressions</h3>
<p>Extend the regular expression matcher to support <code>+</code>, meaning "one or more".</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Match sets of characters</h3>
<p>Add a new regular expression matching class that matches any character from a set,
so that <code>Charset('aeiou')</code> matches any lower-case vowel.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Make repetition more efficient</h3>
<p>Rewrite <code>RegexAny</code> so that it does not repeatedly re-match text.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Lazy matching</h3>
<p>The regular expressions we have seen so far are <a class="glossref" href="#eager_matching" markdown="1">eager</a>:
they match as much as they can, as early as they can.
An alternative is <a class="glossref" href="#lazy_matching" markdown="1">lazy matching</a>,
in which expressions match as little as they need to.
For example,
given the string <code>"ab"</code>,
an eager match with the expression <code>/ab*/</code> will match both letters
(because <code>/b*/</code> matches a 'b' if one is available)
but a lazy match will only match the first letter
(because <code>/b*/</code> can match no letters at all).
Implement lazy matching for the <code>*</code> operator.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Optional matching</h3>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator means "optional",
so that <code>/a?/</code> matches either zero or one occurrences of the letter 'a'.
Implement this operator.</p>

<h2 id="regex-parser-tokenize">Section 8.1:  How can we break text into tokens?</h2>
<p>A <span class="indexentry" index-key="token (in parsing)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#token" markdown="1">token</a></span> is an atom of text,
such as the digits making up a number or the letters making up a variable name.
In our grammar the tokens are the special characters <code>*</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>^</code>, and <code>$</code>,
plus any sequence of one or more other characters (which count as one multi-letter token).
This classification guides the design of our parser:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a character is special, create a token for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is a <span class="indexentry" index-key="literal (in parsing)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#literal" markdown="1">literal</a></span> then:</p>
<ol>
<li>combine it with the current literal if there is one, or</li>
<li>start a new literal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are either special or regular depending on position,
    we must treat them as separate tokens or as part of a literal
    based on where they appear.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can translate these rules almost directly into code
to create a list of objects whose keys are <code>kind</code> and <code>loc</code> (short for location),
with the extra key <code>value</code> for literal values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const SIMPLE = {
  '*': 'Any',
  '|': 'Alt',
  '(': 'GroupStart',
  ')': 'GroupEnd'
}

const tokenize = (text) =&gt; {
  const result = []
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; text.length; i += 1) {
    const c = text[i]
    if (c in SIMPLE) {
      result.push({ kind: SIMPLE[c], loc: i })
    } else if (c === '^') {
      if (i === 0) {
        result.push({ kind: 'Start', loc: i })
      } else {
        combineOrPush(result, c, i)
      }
    } else if (c === '$') {
      if (i === (text.length - 1)) {
        result.push({ kind: 'End', loc: i })
      } else {
        combineOrPush(result, c, i)
      }
    } else {
      combineOrPush(result, c, i)
    }
  }

  return result
}


export default tokenize
</code></pre>
<p>The helper function <code>combineOrPush</code> does exactly what its name says.
If the thing most recently added to the list of tokens isn't a literal,
the new character becomes a new token;
otherwise,
we append the new character to the literal we're building:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const combineOrPush = (soFar, character, location) =&gt; {
  const topIndex = soFar.length - 1
  if ((soFar.length === 0) || (soFar[topIndex].token !== 'Lit')) {
    soFar.push({ kind: 'Lit', value: character, loc: location })
  } else {
    soFar[topIndex].value += character
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can try this out with a three-line test program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import tokenize from './tokenizer-collapse.js'

const test = '^a^b*'
const result = tokenize(test)
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">[
  {
    "kind": "Start",
    "loc": 0
  },
  {
    "kind": "Lit",
    "value": "a",
    "loc": 1
  },
  {
    "kind": "Lit",
    "value": "^",
    "loc": 2
  },
  {
    "kind": "Lit",
    "value": "b",
    "loc": 3
  },
  {
    "kind": "Any",
    "loc": 4
  }
]
</code></pre>
<p>This simple tokenizer is readable, efficient, and wrong.
The problem is that the expression <code>/ab*/</code> means "a single <code>a</code> followed by zero or more <code>b</code>".
If we combine the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> as we read them,
though,
we wind up with "zero or more repetitions of <code>ab</code>".
(Don't feel bad if you didn't spot this:
we didn't notice the problem until we were implementing the next step.)</p>
<p>The solution is to treat each regular character as its own literal in this stage
and then combine things later.
Doing this lets us get rid of the nested <code>if</code> for handling <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const SIMPLE = {
  '*': 'Any',
  '|': 'Alt',
  '(': 'GroupStart',
  ')': 'GroupEnd'
}

const tokenize = (text) =&gt; {
  const result = []
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; text.length; i += 1) {
    const c = text[i]
    if (c in SIMPLE) {
      result.push({ kind: SIMPLE[c], loc: i })
    } else if ((c === '^') &amp;&amp; (i === 0)) {
      result.push({ kind: 'Start', loc: i })
    } else if ((c === '$') &amp;&amp; (i === (text.length - 1))) {
      result.push({ kind: 'End', loc: i })
    } else {
      result.push({ kind: 'Lit', loc: i, value: c })
    }
  }

  return result
}

export default tokenize

<h2 id="regex-parser-tree">Section 8.2:  How can we turn a list of tokens into a tree?</h2>
<p>We now have a list of tokens,
but we need a tree that captures the nesting introduced by parentheses
and the way that <code>*</code> applies to whatever comes before it.
Let's trace a few cases in order to see how to build this tree:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the regular expression is <code>/a/</code>, we create a <code>Lit</code> token for the letter <code>a</code>
    (where "create" means "append to the output list").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if the regular expression is <code>/a*/</code>?
    We first create a <code>Lit</code> token for the <code>a</code> and append it to the output list.
    When we see the <code>*</code>,
    we take that <code>Lit</code> token off the tail of the output list
    and replace it with an <code>Any</code> token that has the <code>Lit</code> token as its child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our next thought experiment is <code>/(ab)/</code>.
    We don't know how long the group is going to be when we see the <code>(</code>,
    so we put the parenthesis onto the output as a marker.
    We then add the <code>Lit</code> tokens for the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
    until we see the <code>)</code>,
    at which point we pull tokens off the end of the output list
    until we get back to the <code>(</code> marker.
    When we find it,
    we put everything we have temporarily collected into a <code>Group</code> token and append it to the output list.
    This algorithm automatically handles <code>/(a*)/</code> and <code>/(a(b*)c)/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about <code>/a|b/</code>?
    We append a <code>Lit</code> token for <code>a</code>, get the <code>|</code> and---and we're stuck,
    because we don't yet have the next token we need to finish building the <code>Alt</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to solve this problem is to check to see if the thing on the top of the stack is waiting to combine
each time we append a new token.
However,
this doesn't handle <code>/a|b*/</code> properly.
The pattern is supposed to mean "one <code>a</code> or any number of <code>b</code>",
but the <span class="indexentry" index-key="parser!check-and-combine" markdown="1">check-and-combine strategy</span> will turn it into the equivalent of <code>/(a|b)*/</code>.</p>
<p>A better (i.e., correct) solution is
to leave some partially-completed tokens in the output and <span class="indexentry" index-key="parser!post-hoc compression strategy" markdown="1">compress</span> them later
(<a class="figref" href="../regex-parser/#regex-parser-mechanics">Figure 8.2</a>).
If our input is the pattern <code>/a|b/</code>, we can:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Append a <code>Lit</code> token for <code>a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we see <code>|</code>,
    make that <code>Lit</code> token the left child of the <code>Alt</code>
    and append that without filling in the right child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Append the <code>Lit</code> token for <code>b</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After all tokens have been handled,
    look for partially-completed <code>Alt</code> tokens and make whatever comes after them their right child.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, this automatically handles patterns like <code>/(ab)|c*|(de)/</code>.</p>

<p>It's time to turn these ideas into code.
The main structure of our parser is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

import tokenize from './tokenizer.js'

const parse = (text) =&gt; {
  const result = []
  const allTokens = tokenize(text)
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; allTokens.length; i += 1) {
    const token = allTokens[i]
    const last = i === allTokens.length - 1
    handle(result, token, last)
  }
  return compress(result)
}


export default parse
</code></pre>
<p>We handle tokens case by case
(with a few assertions to check that patterns are <a class="glossref" href="#well_formed" markdown="1">well formed</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const handle = (result, token, last) =&gt; {
  if (token.kind === 'Lit') {
    result.push(token)
  } else if (token.kind === 'Start') {
    assert(result.length === 0,
      'Should not have start token after other tokens')
    result.push(token)
  } else if (token.kind === 'End') {
    assert(last,
      'Should not have end token before other tokens')
    result.push(token)
  } else if (token.kind === 'GroupStart') {
    result.push(token)
  } else if (token.kind === 'GroupEnd') {
    result.push(groupEnd(result, token))
  } else if (token.kind === 'Any') {
    assert(result.length &gt; 0,
      `No operand for '*' (location ${token.loc})`)
    token.child = result.pop()
    result.push(token)
  } else if (token.kind === 'Alt') {
    assert(result.length &gt; 0,
      `No operand for '*' (location ${token.loc})`)
    token.left = result.pop()
    token.right = null
    result.push(token)
  } else {
    assert(false, 'UNIMPLEMENTED')
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we find the <code>)</code> that marks the end of a group,
we take items from the end of the output list
until we find the matching start
and use them to create a group:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const groupEnd = (result, token) =&gt; {
  const group = {
    kind: 'Group',
    loc: null,
    end: token.loc,
    children: []
  }
  while (true) {
    assert(result.length &gt; 0,
           `Unmatched end parenthesis (location ${token.loc})`)
    const child = result.pop()
    if (child.kind === 'GroupStart') {
      group.loc = child.loc
      break
    }
    group.children.unshift(child)
  }
  return group
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally,
when we have finished with the input,
we go through the output list one last time to fill in the right side of <code>Alt</code>s:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const compress = (raw) =&gt; {
  const cooked = []
  while (raw.length &gt; 0) {
    const token = raw.pop()
    if (token.kind === 'Alt') {
      assert(cooked.length &gt; 0,
             `No right operand for alt (location ${token.loc})`)
      token.right = cooked.shift()
    }
    cooked.unshift(token)
  }
  return cooked
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once again,
it's not done until we've tested it:</p>

<p>While our final parser is less than 90 lines of code,
it is doing a lot of complex things.
Compared to parsers for things like JSON and YAML,
though,
it is still very simple.
If we have more operators with different <span class="indexentry" index-key="operator precedence!implementing" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#precedence" markdown="1">precedences</a></span>
we should switch to the <span class="indexentry" index-key="shunting-yard algorithm;parser!shunting-yard algorithm" markdown="1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm">shunting-yard algorithm</a></span>,
and if we need to handle a language like JavaScript we should explore tools like <span class="indexentry" index-key="ANTLR" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a></span>,
which can generate a parser automatically given a description of the language to be parsed.
As we said at the start,
though,
if our design requires us to write a parser we should try to come up with a better design.
CSV, JSON, YAML, and other formats <a href="https://third-bit.com/2015/06/11/why-we-cant-have-nice-things/">have their quirks</a>,
but at least they're broken the same way everywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The limits of computing</h3>
<p>One of the most important theoretical results in computer science is that
every formal language corresponds to a type of abstract machine and vice versa,
and that some languages (or machines) are more or less powerful than others.
For example,
every regular expression corresponds to a <span class="indexentry" index-key="finite state machine!correspondence with regular expressions" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#fsm" markdown="1">finite state machine</a></span> (FSM)
like the one in <a class="figref" href="../regex-parser/#regex-parser-finite-state-machine">Figure 8.3</a>.
As powerful as FSMs are,
they cannot match things like nested parentheses or HTML tags,
and <span class="indexentry" index-key="sin!using regular expressions to parse HTML" markdown="1"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">attempting to do so is a sin</a></span>.
If you add a stack to the system you can process a much richer set of languages,
and if you add two stacks you have something equivalent to a <span class="indexentry" index-key="Turing Machine" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#turing_machine" markdown="1">Turing Machine</a></span>
that can do any conceivable computation.

</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="page-templates">Chapter 9: Page Templates</h1>
<p>Every program needs documentation in order to be usable,
and the best place to put that documentation is on the web.
Writing and updating pages by hand is time-consuming and error-prone,
particularly when many parts are the same,
so most documentation sites use some kind of
<span class="indexentry" index-key="static site generator" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#static_site_generator" markdown="1">static site generator</a></span>
to create web pages from templates.</p>
<p>At the heart of every static site generator is a page templating system.
Thousands of these have been written in the last thirty years
in every popular programming language
(and one language, <span class="indexentry" index-key="PHP" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a></span>, was created for this purpose).
Most of these systems use one of three designs
(<a class="figref" href="../page-templates/#page-templates-options">Figure 9.1</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mix commands in a language such as JavaScript with the HTML or Markdown
    using some kind of marker to indicate which parts are commands
    and which parts are to be taken as-is.
    This approach is taken by <span class="indexentry" index-key="EJS" markdown="1"><a href="https://ejs.co/">EJS</a></span>,
    which we used to write these lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a mini-language with its own commands like <span class="indexentry" index-key="Jekyll" markdown="1"><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></span>
    (which is used by <span class="indexentry" index-key="GitHub Pages" markdown="1"><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></span>).
    Mini-languages are appealing because they are smaller and safer than general-purpose languages,
    but experience shows that they eventually grow
    most of the features of a general-purpose language.
    Again, some kind of marker must be used to show
    which parts of the page are code and which are ordinary text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put directives in specially-named attributes in the HTML.
    This approach has been the least popular,
    but since pages are valid HTML,
    it eliminates the need for a special parser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<figure id="page-templates-options">
<img alt="Three options for page templates" src="./page-templates/figures/options.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 9.1: Three different ways to implement page templating.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this chapter we will build a simple page templating system using the third strategy.
We will process each page independently by parsing the HTML
and walking the <span class="indexentry" index-key="DOM" markdown="1">DOM</span> to find nodes with special attributes.
Our program will execute the instructions in those nodes
to do the equivalent of loops and if/else statements;
other nodes will be copied as-is to create text.</p>
<div class="break-before"></div>
<h2 id="page-templates-syntax">Section 9.1:  What will our system look like?</h2>
<p>Let's start by deciding what "done" looks like.
Suppose we want to turn an array of strings into an HTML list.
Our page will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expect three items&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul z-loop="item:names"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span z-var="item"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The attribute <code>z-loop</code> tells the tool to repeat the contents of that node;
the loop variable and the collection being looped over are separated by a colon.
The attribute <code>z-var</code> tells the tool to fill in the node with the value of the variable.</p>
<p>When our tool processes this page,
the output will be standard HTML without any traces of how it was created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body style="font-size: 200%; margin-left: 0.5em"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expect three items&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Johnson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vaughan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jackson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Human-readable vs. machine-readable</h3>
<p>The introduction said that mini-languages for page templating
quickly start to accumulate extra features.
We have already started down that road
by putting the loop variable and loop target in a single attribute
and splitting that attribute to get them out.
Doing this makes loops easy for people to type,
but hides important information from standard HTML processing tools.
They can't know that this particular attribute of these particular elements
contains multiple values
or that those values should be extracted by splitting a string on a colon.
We could instead require people to use two attributes, as in:</p>
<p><code>html
&lt;ul z-loop="names" z-loop-var="item"&gt;</code></p>
<p class="continue">but we have decided to err on the side of minimal typing.
And note that strictly speaking,
we should call our attributes <code>data-something</code> instead of <code>z-something</code>
to conform with <span class="indexentry" index-key="HTML5 specification" markdown="1"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes">the HTML5 specification</a></span>,
but by the time we're finished processing our templates,
there shouldn't be any <code>z-*</code> attributes left to confuse a browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next step is to define the API for filling in templates.
Our tool needs the template itself,
somewhere to write its output,
and some variables to use in the expansion.
These variables might come from a configuration file,
from a YAML header in the file itself,
or from some mix of the two;
for the moment,
we will just pass them into the expansion function as an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const variables = {
  names: ['Johnson', 'Vaughan', 'Jackson']
}
const dom = readHtml('template.html') // eslint-disable-line
const expander = new Expander(dom, variables) // eslint-disable-line
expander.walk()
console.log(expander.result)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="page-templates-values">Section 9.2:  How can we keep track of values?</h2>
<p>Speaking of variables,
we need a way to keep track of their current values;
we say "current" because the value of a loop variable changes each time we go around the loop.
We also need to maintain multiple sets of variables
so that variables used inside a loop
don't conflict with ones used outside it.
(We don't actually "need" to do this---we could just have one global set of variables---but
experience teaches us that if all our variables are global,
all of our programs will be buggy.)</p>
<p>The standard way to manage variables is to create a stack of lookup tables.
Each <span class="indexentry" index-key="stack frame" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#stack_frame" markdown="1">stack frame</a></span> is an object with names and values;
when we need to find a variable,
we look through the stack frames in order to find the uppermost definition of that variable..</p>

In contrast,

Its methods let us push and pop new stack frames

it uses that instead.</p>

<p>The <code>Expander</code> class is specialization of <code>Visitor</code>
that uses an <code>Env</code> to keep track of variables.
It imports a handler
for each type of special node we support---we will write those in a moment---and
uses them to process each type of node:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the node is plain text, copy it to the output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a handler for the node,
    call the handler's <code>open</code> or <code>close</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, open or close a regular tag.</p>

<p>Checking to see if there is a handler for a particular node
and getting that handler are straightforward---we just
look at the node's attributes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  hasHandler (node) {
    for (const name in node.attribs) {
      if (name in this.handlers) {
        return true
      }

    return false
  }

  getHandler (node) {
    const possible = Object.keys(node.attribs)
      .filter(name =&gt; name in this.handlers)
    assert(possible.length === 1,
      'Should be exactly one handler')
    return this.handlers[possible[0]]
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need a few helper methods to show tags and generate output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  showTag (node, closing) {
    if (closing) {
      this.output(`&lt;/${node.name}&gt;`)
      return
    }

    this.output(`&lt;${node.name}`)
    if (node.name === 'body') {
      this.output(' style="font-size: 200%; margin-left: 0.5em"')
    }
    for (const name in node.attribs) {
      if (!name.startsWith('z-')) {
        this.output(` ${name}="${node.attribs[name]}"`)
      }
    }
    this.output('&gt;')
  }

  output (text) {
    this.result.push((text === undefined) ? 'UNDEF' : text)
  }

  getResult () {
    return this.result.join('')
  }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Notice that this class adds strings to an array and joins them all right at the end
rather than concatenating strings repeatedly.
Doing this is more efficient and also helps with debugging,
since each string in the array corresponds to a single method call.</p>
<h2 id="page-templates-handlers">Section 9.4:  How do we implement node handlers?</h2>
<p>At this point
we have built a lot of infrastructure but haven't actually processed any special nodes.
To do that,
let's write a handler that copies a constant number into the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export default {
  open: (expander, node) =&gt; {
    expander.showTag(node, false)
    expander.output(node.attribs['z-num'])
  },

  close: (expander, node) =&gt; {
    expander.showTag(node, true)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">When we enter a node like <code>&lt;span z-num="123"/&gt;</code>
this handler asks the expander to show an opening tag
followed by the value of the <code>z-num</code> attribute.
When we exit the node,
the handler asks the expander to close the tag.
The handler doesn't know whether things are printed immediately,
added to an output list,
or something else;
it just knows that whoever called it implements the low-level operations it needs.</p>
<p>Note that this expander is <em>not</em> a class,
but instead an object with two functions stored under the keys <code>open</code> and <code>close</code>.
We could use a class for each handler
so that handlers can store any extra state they need,
but <span class="indexentry" index-key="bare object;software design!bare object" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#bare_object" markdown="1">bare objects</a></span> are common and useful in JavaScript
(though we will see below that we <em>should</em> have used classes).</p>
<p>So much for constants; what about variables?</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export default {
  open: (expander, node) =&gt; {
    expander.showTag(node, false)
    expander.output(expander.env.find(node.attribs['z-var']))
  },

  close: (expander, node) =&gt; {
    expander.showTag(node, true)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">This code is almost the same as the previous example.
The only difference is that instead of copying the attribute's value
directly to the output,
we use it as a key to look up a value in the environment.</p>
<p>These two pairs of handlers look plausible, but do they work?
To find out,
we can build a program that loads variable definitions from a JSON file,
reads an HTML template,
and does the expansion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'
import htmlparser2 from 'htmlparser2'

import Expander from './expander.js'

const main = () =&gt; {
  const vars = readJSON(process.argv[2])
  const doc = readHtml(process.argv[3])
  const expander = new Expander(doc, vars)
  expander.walk()
  console.log(expander.getResult())
}

const readJSON = (filename) =&gt; {
  const text = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8')
  return JSON.parse(text)
}

const readHtml = (filename) =&gt; {
  const text = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8')
  return htmlparser2.parseDOM(text)[0]
}

main()
</code></pre>
<p>We added new variables for our test cases one by one
as we were writing this chapter.
To avoid repeating text repeatedly,
we show the entire set once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "firstVariable": "firstValue",
  "secondVariable": "secondValue",
  "variableName": "variableValue",
  "showThis": true,
  "doNotShowThis": false,
  "names": ["Johnson", "Vaughan", "Jackson"]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our first test:
is static text copied over as-is (<a class="figref" href="../page-templates/#page-templates-output-static-text">Figure 9.4</a>)?</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;text&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This page has:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;static&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;text&lt;/li&gt;

<h2 id="page-templates-flow">Section 9.5:  How can we implement control flow?</h2>
<p>Our tool supports two types of control flow:
conditional expressions and loops.
Since we don't support Boolean expressions like <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>,
implementing a conditional is as simple as looking up a variable
(which we know how to do)
and then expanding the node if the value is true:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export default {
  open: (expander, node) =&gt; {
    const doRest = expander.env.find(node.attribs['z-if'])

<blockquote class="break-before">
<h3>Spot the bug</h3>
<p>This implementation of <code>if</code> contains a subtle bug.
The <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> functions both check the value of the control variable.
If something inside the body of the <code>if</code> changes that value,
the result could be an opening tag without a matching closing tag or vice versa.
We haven't implemented an assignment operator,
so right now there's no way for that to happen,
but it's a plausible thing for us to add later,
and tracking down a bug in old code that is revealed by new code
is always a headache.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally we come to loops.
For these,
we need to get the array we're looping over from the environment
and do something for each of its elements.
That "something" is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new stack frame holding the current value of the loop variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand all of the node's children with that stack frame in place.</p>

<li>
<p>Pop the stack frame to get rid of the temporary variable.</p>

</figure>
<p>Notice how we create the new stack frame using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{ [indexName]: index }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">This is an ugly but useful trick.
We can't write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{ indexName: index }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">because that would create an object with the string <code>indexName</code> as a key,
rather than one with the value of the variable <code>indexName</code> as its key.
We can't do this either:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{ `${indexName}`: index }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">though it seems like we should be able to.
Instead,
we create an array containing the string we want.
Since JavaScript automatically converts arrays to strings
by concatenating their elements when it needs to,
our expression is a quick way to get the same effect as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const temp = {}
temp[indexName] = index
expander.env.push(temp)
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Those three lines <em>are</em> much easier to understand, though,
so we should probably have been less clever.</p>
<h2 id="page-templates-learning">Section 9.6:  How did we know how to do all of this?</h2>
<p>We have just implemented a simple programming language.
It can't do arithmetic,
but if we wanted to add tags like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">&lt;span z-math="+"&gt;&lt;span z-var="width"/&gt;&lt;span z-num="1"//&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">we could.
It's unlikely anyone would use the result---typing all of that
is so much clumsier than typing <code>width+1</code> that people wouldn't use it
unless they had no other choice---but the basic design is there.</p>
<p>We didn't invent any of this from scratch,
any more than we invented the parsing algorithm of <a class="crossref" href="#regex-parser">Chapter 8</a>.
Instead,
we did what you are doing now:
we read what other programmers had written
and tried to make sense of the key ideas.</p>
<p>The problem is that "making sense" depends on who we are.
When we use a low-level language,
we incur the <span class="indexentry" index-key="cognitive load" markdown="1">cognitive load</span> of assembling micro-steps into something more meaningful.
When we use a high-level language,
on the other hand,
we incur a similar load translating functions of functions of functions
(or meta-classes templated on object factories)
into actual operations on actual data.</p>
<p>More experienced programmers are more capable at both ends of the curve,
but that's not the only thing that changes.
If a novice's comprehension curve looks like the one on the left
of <a class="figref" href="../page-templates/#page-templates-comprehension">Figure 9.10</a>,
then an expert's looks like the one on the right.
Experts don't just understand more at all levels of abstraction;
their <em>preferred</em> level has also shifted
so that \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\)
is actually more readable than the medieval expression
"the side of the square whose area is the sum of the areas of the two squares
whose sides are given by the first part and the second part".</p>
<figure id="page-templates-comprehension">
<img alt="Comprehension curves" src="./page-templates/figures/comprehension.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 9.10: Novice and expert comprehension curves.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One implication of this is that for any given task,
the software that is quickest for a novice to comprehend
will almost certainly be different from the software that
an expert can understand most quickly.
In an ideal world our tools would automatically re-represent programs at different levels,
so that with a click of a button we could view our code as either:</p>
<pre><code>const hosts = links.map(a =&gt; a.href.split(':')[1].split('/')[0]).unique()
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>hosts = []
for (each a in links) do
  temp &lt;- attr(a, 'href').split(':')[1].split('/')[0]
  if (not (temp in hosts)) do
    hosts.append(temp)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>just as we could change the colors used for syntax highlighting
or the depth to which loop bodies are indented.
But today's tools don't do that,
and I suspect that any IDE smart enough to translate between comprehension levels automatically
would also be smart enough to write the code without our help.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Literal text</h3>
<p>Add a directive <code>&lt;div z-literal="true"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;</code> that copies the enclosed text as-is
without interpreting or expanding any contained directives.
(A directive like this would be needed when writing documentation for the template expander.)</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Including other files</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a directive <code>&lt;div z-include="filename.html"/&gt;</code> that includes another file
    in the file being processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should included files be processed and the result copied into the including file,
    or should the text be copied in and then processed?
    What difference does it make to the way variables are evaluated?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">HTML snippets</h3>
<p>Add a directive <code>&lt;div z-snippet="variable"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;</code> that saves some text in a variable
so that it can be displayed later.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div z-snippet="prefix"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expect three items&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li z-loop="item:names"&gt;
        &lt;span z-var="prefix"&gt;&lt;span z-var="item"/&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">would printed the word "Important:" in bold before each item in the list.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">YAML headers</h3>
<p>Modify the template expander to handle variables defined in a YAML header in the page being processed.
For example, if the page is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">---
name: "Dorothy Johnson Vaughan"
---
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span z-var="name"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">will create a paragraph containing the given name.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Expanding all files</h3>
<p>Write a program <code>expand-all.js</code> that takes two directory names as command-line arguments
and builds a website in the second directory by expanding all of the HTML files found in the first
or in sub-directories of the first.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Counting loops</h3>
<p>Add a directive <code>&lt;div z-index="indexName" z-limit="limitName"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;</code>
that loops from zero to the value in the variable <code>limitName</code>,
putting the current iteration index in <code>indexName</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Auxiliary functions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify <code>Expander</code> so that it takes an extra argument <code>auxiliaries</code>
    containing zero or more named functions:</p>
<p><code>js
const expander = new Expander(root, vars, {
  max: Math.max,
  trim: (x) =&gt; x.trim()
})</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a directive <code>&lt;span z-call="functionName" z-args="var,var"/&gt;</code>
    that looks up a function in <code>auxiliaries</code> and calls it
    with the given variables as arguments.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose we are using a page templating system to create a website (<a class="crossref" href="#page-templates">Chapter 9</a>).
If we a change a single page our tool should translate it,
but shouldn't waste time translating others.
If we change a template,
on the other hand,
the tool should realize that every page in the site is potentially affected
and automatically re-translate all of them.</p>
<p>Choosing what actions to take based on how files depend on one another is a common pattern.
For example,
programs in <span class="indexentry" index-key="compiled language;language!compiled" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#compiled_language" markdown="1">compiled languages</a></span>
like <span class="indexentry" index-key="C" markdown="1">C</span> and <span class="indexentry" index-key="Java" markdown="1">Java</span>
have to be translated into lower-level forms before they can run.
In fact,
there are usually two stages to the translation:
compiling each source file into some intermediate form,
and then <span class="indexentry" index-key="linking (compiled language);compiled language!linking" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#link" markdown="1">linking</a></span> the compiled modules
to each other and to libraries
to create a runnable program
(<a class="figref" href="../build-manager/#build-manager-compiling">Figure 10.1</a>).
If a source file hasn't changed,
there's no need to recompile it before linking.</p>

<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 10.1: Compiling source files and linking the resulting modules.</figcaption>

<p>A <span class="indexentry" index-key="build manager" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#build_manager" markdown="1">build manager</a></span> takes a description of what depends on what,
figures out which files are out of date,
determines an order in which to rebuild things,
and then executes any necessary steps.
Originally created to manage compilation,
they are also useful for programs written in <span class="indexentry" index-key="language!interpreted;interpreted language" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#interpreted_language" markdown="1">interpreted languages</a></span>
like JavaScript
when we want to bundle multiple modules into a single loadable file (<a class="crossref" href="#module-bundler">Chapter 17</a>)
or re-create documentation from source code (<a class="crossref" href="#doc-generator">Chapter 16</a>).
In this chapter we will create a simple build manager
based on <span class="indexentry" index-key="Make" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a></span>, <span class="indexentry" index-key="Bajel" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bajel">Bajel</a></span>, <span class="indexentry" index-key="Jake" markdown="1"><a href="https://jakejs.com/">Jake</a></span>,
and other systems discussed in <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Smith2011">Smith2011</a></span>.</p>
<h2 id="build-manager-contents">Section 10.1:  What's in a build manager?</h2>
<p>The input to a build manager is a set of rules,
each of which has:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a <span class="indexentry" index-key="build target;target!build" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#build_target" markdown="1">target</a></span>, which is the file to be updated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some <span class="indexentry" index-key="dependency (in build);build!dependency" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#dependency" markdown="1">dependencies</a></span>, which are the things that file depends on;
    and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a <span class="indexentry" index-key="recipe (in build);build!recipe" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#build_recipe" markdown="1">recipe</a></span> that specifies how to update the target
    if it is out of date compared to its dependencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The target of one rule can be a dependency of another rule,
so the relationships between the files form a <span class="indexentry" index-key="directed acyclic graph (DAG);DAG" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#dag" markdown="1">directed acyclic graph</a></span> or DAG
(<a class="figref" href="../build-manager/#build-manager-dependencies">Figure 10.2</a>).
The graph is directed because "A depends on B" is a one-way relationship;
it cannot contain cycles (or loops) because
if something depends on itself we can never finish updating it.
We say that a target is <span class="indexentry" index-key="stale (in build);build!stale" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#build_stale" markdown="1">stale</a></span> if it is older than any of its dependencies.
When this happens,
we use the recipes to bring it up to date.</p>

<img alt="Respecting dependencies" src="./build-manager/figures/dependencies.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 10.2: How a build manager finds and respects dependencies.</figcaption>

<p>Our build manager must:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read a file containing rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct the dependency graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out which targets are stale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build those targets,
    making sure to build things <em>before</em> anything that depends on them is built.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Topological order</h3>
<p>A <span class="indexentry" index-key="topological order" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#topological_order" markdown="1">topological ordering</a></span> of a graph
arranges the nodes so that every node comes after everything it depends on.
For example,
if A depends on both B and C,
then (B, C, A) and (C, B, A) are both valid topological orders of the graph.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="build-manager-start">Section 10.2:  Where should we start?</h2>
<p>We will store our rules in YAML files like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">- target: A
  depends:
  - B
  - C
  recipes:
  - "update A from B and C"
- target: B
  depends:
  - C
  recipes:
  - "update B from C"
- target: C
  depends: []
  recipes: []
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">We could equally well have used JSON,
but it wouldn't have made sense to use CSV:
rules have a nested structure,
and CSV doesn't represent nesting particularly gracefully.</p>
<p>We are going to create our build manager in stages,
so we start by writing a simple <span class="indexentry" index-key="software design!driver" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#driver" markdown="1">driver</a></span> that loads a JavaScript source file,
creates an object of whatever class that file exports,
and runs the <code>.build</code> method of that object with the rest of the command-line parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = async () =&gt; {
  const BuilderClass = (await import(process.argv[2])).default
  const builder = new BuilderClass(...process.argv.slice(3))
  try {
    builder.build()
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Build failed:', err)
  }
}

main()
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">We use the <code>import</code> function to dynamically load files containing in <a class="crossref" href="#unit-test">Chapter 4</a> as well.
It only saves us a few lines of code in this case,
but we will use this idea of a general-purpose driver for larger programs in future chapters.</p>
<p>To work with our driver,
each version of our build manager must be a class that satisfies two requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Its constructor must take a configuration file as an argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must provide a <code>build</code> method that needs no arguments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>build</code> method must create a graph from the configuration file,
check that it does not contain any <a class="glossref" href="#cycle" markdown="1">cycles</a>,
and then run whatever commands are needed to update stale targets.
Just as we built a generic <span class="indexentry" index-key="Visitor pattern;design pattern!Visitor" markdown="1"><code>Visitor</code></span> class in <a class="crossref" href="#page-templates">Chapter 9</a>,
we can build a generic base class for our build manager that does these steps in this order
without actually implementing any of them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

class SkeletonBuilder {
  constructor (configFile) {
    this.configFile = configFile
  }

  build () {
    this.loadConfig()
    this.buildGraph()
    this.checkCycles()
    this.run()
  }

  loadConfig () {
    assert(false, 'not implemented')
  }

  buildGraph () {
    assert(false, 'not implemented')
  }

  checkCycles () {
    assert(false, 'not implemented')
  }

  run () {
    assert.fail('run method not implemented')
  }
}

export default SkeletonBuilder
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of
the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Template Method pattern;design pattern!Template Method" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#template_method_pattern" markdown="1">Template Method</a></span> design pattern:
the parent class defines the order of the steps
and child classes fill them in
(<a class="figref" href="../build-manager/#build-manager-template-method">Figure 10.3</a>).
This design pattern ensures that every child does the same things in the same order,
even if the details of <em>how</em> vary from case to case.</p>
<figure id="build-manager-template-method">
<img alt="Template Method pattern" src="./build-manager/figures/template-method.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 10.3: The Template Method pattern in action.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We would normally implement all of the methods required by the <code>build</code> method at the same time,
but to make the evolving code easier to follow we will write them them one by one.
The <code>loadConfig</code> method loads the configuration file
as the builder object is being constructed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'
import fs from 'fs'
import yaml from 'js-yaml'

import SkeletonBuilder from './skeleton-builder.js'

class ConfigLoader extends SkeletonBuilder {
  loadConfig () {
    this.config = yaml.safeLoad(fs.readFileSync(this.configFile, 'utf-8'))

    assert(Array.isArray(this.config),
      'Configuration must be array')

    this.config.forEach(rule =&gt; {
      assert(('target' in rule) &amp;&amp; (typeof rule.target === 'string'),
        `Rule ${JSON.stringify(rule)} does not string as 'target'`)

      assert(('depends' in rule) &amp;&amp;
        Array.isArray(rule.depends) &amp;&amp;
        rule.depends.every(dep =&gt; (typeof dep === 'string')),
        `Bad 'depends' for rule ${JSON.stringify(rule)}`)

      assert(('recipes' in rule) &amp;&amp;
        Array.isArray(rule.recipes) &amp;&amp;
        rule.recipes.every(recipe =&gt; (typeof recipe === 'string')),
        `Bad 'recipes' for rule ${JSON.stringify(rule)}`)
    })
  }
}

export default ConfigLoader
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The first line does the loading;
the rest of the method checks that the rules are at least superficially plausible.
We need these checks because YAML is a generic file format
that doesn't know anything about the extra requirements of our rules.
And as we first saw in <a class="crossref" href="#async-programming">Chapter 3</a>,
we have to specify that the character encoding of our file is UTF-8
so that JavaScript knows how to convert bytes into text.</p>
<p>The next step is to turn the configuration into a graph in memory.
We use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphlib"><code>graphlib</code></a> module to manage nodes and links
rather than writing our own classes for graphs,
and store the recipe to rebuild a node in that node.
Two features of <code>graphlib</code> that took us a while to figure out are that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>links go <em>from</em> the dependency <em>to</em> the target,
    and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>setEdge</code> automatically adds nodes if they aren't already present.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>graphlib</code> provides implementations of some common graph algorithms,
including one to check for cycles,
so we might as well write that method at this point as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'
import graphlib from '@dagrejs/graphlib'

import ConfigLoader from './config-loader.js'

class GraphCreator extends ConfigLoader {
  buildGraph () {
    this.graph = new graphlib.Graph()
    this.config.forEach(rule =&gt; {
      this.graph.setNode(rule.target, {
        recipes: rule.recipes
      })
      rule.depends.forEach(dep =&gt; this.graph.setEdge(dep, rule.target))
    })
  }

  checkCycles () {
    const cycles = graphlib.alg.findCycles(this.graph)
    assert.strictEqual(cycles.length, 0,
      `Dependency graph contains cycles ${cycles}`)
  }
}

export default GraphCreator
</code></pre>
<p>We can now create something that displays our configuration when it runs
but does nothing else:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import graphlib from '@dagrejs/graphlib'

import GraphCreator from './graph-creator.js'

class DisplayOnly extends GraphCreator {
  run () {
    console.log('Graph')
    console.log(graphlib.json.write(this.graph))
    console.log('Sorted')
    console.log(graphlib.alg.topsort(this.graph))
  }
}

export default DisplayOnly
</code></pre>
<p>If we run this with our three simple rules as input,
it shows the graph with <code>v</code> and <code>w</code> keys to represent the ends of the links:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node driver.js ./display-only.js three-simple-rules.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">Graph
{
  options: { directed: true, multigraph: false, compound: false },
  nodes: [
    { v: 'A', value: [Object] },
    { v: 'B', value: [Object] },
    { v: 'C', value: [Object] }
  ],
  edges: [ { v: 'B', w: 'A' }, { v: 'C', w: 'A' }, { v: 'C', w: 'B' } ]
}
Sorted
[ 'C', 'B', 'A' ]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's write a quick test to make sure the cycle detector works as intended:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">- target: A
  depends:
  - B
  recipes:
  - "update A from B"
- target: B
  depends:
  - A
  recipes:
  - "update B from A"
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node driver.js ./display-only.js circular-rules.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">Build failed: AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Dependency graph contains \
 cycles B,A

  expected: 0,
  operator: 'strictEqual'
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="build-manager-timestamp">Section 10.3:  How can we specify that a file is out of date?</h2>
<p>The next step is to figure out which files are out of date.
Make does this by comparing the <span class="indexentry" index-key="timestamp!in build;build!timestamp" markdown="1">timestamps</span> of the files in question,
but this isn't always reliable:
<span class="indexentry" index-key="clock synchronization (in build);build!clock synchronization" markdown="1">computers' clocks may be slightly out of sync</span>,
which can produce a wrong answer on a networked filesystem,
and the operating system may only report file update times to the nearest millisecond
(which seemed very short in 1970 but seems very long today).</p>
<p>More modern build systems store a <span class="indexentry" index-key="hash code!in build;build!hash code" markdown="1">hash</span> of each file's contents
and compare the current hash to the stored one to see if the file has changed.
Since we already looked at hashing in <a class="crossref" href="#file-backup">Chapter 5</a>,
we will use the timestamp approach here.
And instead of using a mock filesystem as we did in <a class="crossref" href="#file-backup">Chapter 5</a>,
we will simply load another configuration file that specifies fake timestamps for files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">A: 2
B: 5
C: 8
</code></pre>
<p>Since we want to associate those timestamps with files,
we add a step to <code>buildGraph</code> to read the timestamp file and add information to the graph's nodes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'
import fs from 'fs'
import yaml from 'js-yaml'

import GraphCreator from './graph-creator.js'

class AddTimestamps extends GraphCreator {
  constructor (configFile, timesFile) {
    super(configFile)
    this.timesFile = timesFile
  }

  buildGraph () {
    super.buildGraph()
    this.addTimestamps()
  }

  addTimestamps () {
    const times = yaml.safeLoad(fs.readFileSync(this.timesFile, 'utf-8'))
    for (const node of Object.keys(times)) {
      assert(this.graph.hasNode(node),
             `Graph does not have node ${node}`)
      this.graph.node(node).timestamp = times[node]
    }
    const missing = this.graph.nodes().filter(
      n =&gt; !('timestamp' in this.graph.node(n))
    )
    assert.strictEqual(missing.length, 0,
      `Timestamp missing for node(s) ${missing}`)
  }

  run () {
    console.log(this.graph.nodes().map(
      n =&gt; `${n}: ${JSON.stringify(this.graph.node(n))}`
    ))
  }
}

export default AddTimestamps
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Not quite what we were expecting</h3>
<p>The steps defined in <code>SkeletonBuilder.build</code> don't change when we do this,
so people reading the code don't have to change their mental model of what it does overall.
However,
if we had realized in advance that we were going to want to add timestamps from a file,
we would probably have added a step for that in the template method.
And if someone ever wants to inject a new step between building the graph and adding timestamps,
they will have to override <code>addTimestamps</code> and put their step at the top before calling <code>super.addTimestamps</code>,
which will make the code a lot harder to understand.
We will reflect on this in the last section of this chapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we move on,
let's make sure that adding timestamps works as we want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node driver.js ./add-timestamps.js three-simple-rules.yml add-timestamps.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">[
  'A: {"recipes":["update A from B and C"],"timestamp":2}',
  'B: {"recipes":["update B from C"],"timestamp":5}',
  'C: {"recipes":[],"timestamp":8}'
]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="build-manager-update">Section 10.4:  How can we update out-of-date files?</h2>
<p>To figure out which recipes to execute and in which order,
we set the pretended current time to the latest time of any file,
then look at each file in topological order.
If a file is older than any of its dependencies,
we update the file <em>and</em> its pretended timestamp
to trigger an update of anything that depends on it.</p>
<p>We can pretend that updating a file always takes one unit of time,
so we advance our fictional clock by one for each build.
Using <code>graphlib.alg.topsort</code> to create the topological order,
we get this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import graphlib from '@dagrejs/graphlib'

import AddTimestamps from './add-timestamps.js'

class UpdateOnTimestamps extends AddTimestamps {
  run () {
    const sorted = graphlib.alg.topsort(this.graph)
    const startTime = 1 + Math.max(...sorted.map(
      n =&gt; this.graph.node(n).timestamp))
    console.log(`${startTime}: START`)
    const endTime = sorted.reduce((currTime, node) =&gt; {
      if (this.isStale(node)) {
        console.log(`${currTime}: ${node}`)
        this.graph.node(node).recipes.forEach(
          a =&gt; console.log(`    ${a}`))
        this.graph.node(node).timestamp = currTime
        currTime += 1
      }
      return currTime
    }, startTime)
    console.log(`${endTime}: END`)
  }

  isStale (node) {
    return this.graph.predecessors(node).some(
      other =&gt; this.graph.node(other).timestamp &gt;=
        this.graph.node(node).timestamp
    )
  }
}

export default UpdateOnTimestamps
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>run</code> method:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gets a sorted list of nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sets the starting time to be one unit past the largest file time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses <span class="indexentry" index-key="Array.reduce" markdown="1"><code>Array.reduce</code></span> to operate on each node (i.e., each file) in order.
    If that file is stale,
    we print the steps we would run and then update the file's timestamp.
    We only advance the notional current time when we do an update.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to check if a file is stale,
we see if any of its dependencies currently have timestamps greater than or equal to its.
When we run this,
it seems to do the right thing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node driver.js ./update-timestamps.js three-simple-rules.yml add-timestamps.yml
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">9: START

    update A from B and C
11: END

<div class="break-before"></div>
<h2 id="build-manager-generic">Section 10.5:  How can we add generic build rules?</h2>
<p>If our website has a hundred blog posts
or a hundred pages of documentation about particular JavaScript files,
we don't want to have to write a hundred nearly-identical recipes.
Instead,
we want to be able to write generic <span class="indexentry" index-key="build!rule;rule (in build)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#build_rule" markdown="1">build rules</a></span> that say,
"Build all things of this kind the same way."
These generic rules need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a way to define a set of files;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a way to specify a generic rule;
    and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a way to fill in parts of that rule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will achieve this by overriding <code>buildGraph</code> to replace variables in recipes with values.
Once again,
object-oriented programming helps us change only what we need to change,
provided we divided our problem into sensible chunks in the first place.</p>
<p>Make provides <span class="indexentry" index-key="automatic variable (in build);build!automatic variable" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#automatic_variable" markdown="1">automatic variables</a></span>
with names like <code>$&lt;</code> and <code>$@</code>
to represent the parts of a rule.
Our variables will be more readable:
we will use <code>@TARGET</code> for the target,
<code>@DEPENDENCIES</code> for the dependencies (in order),
and <code>@DEP[1]</code>, <code>@DEP[2]</code>, and so on for specific dependencies
(<a class="figref" href="../build-manager/#build-manager-pattern-rules">Figure 10.4</a>).</p>

<p>Our variable expander looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import UpdateOnTimestamps from './update-timestamps.js'

class VariableExpander extends UpdateOnTimestamps {
  buildGraph () {
    super.buildGraph()
    this.expandVariables()
  }

  expandVariables () {
    this.graph.nodes().forEach(target =&gt; {
      try {
        const dependencies = this.graph.predecessors(target)
        const recipes = this.graph.node(target).recipes
        this.graph.node(target).recipes = recipes.map(act =&gt; {
          act = act
            .replace('@TARGET', target)
            .replace('@DEPENDENCIES', dependencies.join(' '))
          dependencies.forEach((dep, i) =&gt; {
            act = act.replace(`@DEP[${i}]`, dependencies[i])
          })
          return act
        })
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Cannot find ${target} in graph`)
        process.exit(1)
      }
    })
  }
}

export default VariableExpander
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we do is test that it works when there <em>aren't</em> any variables to expand
by running it on the same example we used previously:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">9: START
9: B
    update B from C
10: A
    update A from B C
11: END
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">This is perhaps the most important reason to create tests:
they tell us right away if something we have added or changed
has broken something that used to work.
That gives us a firm base to build on as we debug the new code.</p>
<p>Now we need to add <span class="indexentry" index-key="pattern rule (in build);build!pattern rule" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#pattern_rule" markdown="1">pattern rules</a></span>.
Our first attempt at a rules file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">- target: left.out
  depends: []
  recipes: []
  timestamp: 1
- target: left.in
  depends: []
  recipes: []
  timestamp: 2
- target: right.out
  depends: []
  recipes: []
  timestamp: 1
- target: right.in
  depends: []
  recipes: []
  timestamp: 3
- target: "%.out"
  depends:
  - "%.in"
  recipes:
  - "update @TARGET from @DEPENDENCIES"
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and our first attempt at reading it extracts rules before expanding variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import VariableExpander from './variable-expander.js'

class PatternUserAttempt extends VariableExpander {
  buildGraph () {
    super.buildGraph()
    this.extractRules()
    this.expandVariables()
  }

  extractRules () {
    this.rules = new Map()
    this.graph.nodes().forEach(target =&gt; {
      if (target.includes('%')) {
        const data = {
          recipes: this.graph.node(target).recipes
        }
        this.rules.set(target, data)
      }
    })
    this.rules.forEach((value, key) =&gt; {
      this.graph.removeNode(key)
    })
  }
}

export default PatternUserAttempt
</code></pre>
<p>However,
that doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">Build failed: AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Graph does not have node A

</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The problem is that our simple graph loader creates nodes for dependencies even if they aren't targets.
As a result,
we wind up tripping over the lack of a node for <code>%.in</code> before we get to extracting rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Errors become assertions</h3>
<p>When we first wrote <code>add-timestamps.js</code>,
it didn't contain the assertion
that printed the error message shown above.
Once we tracked down our bug,
though,
we added the assertion to ensure we didn't make the same mistake again,
and as <span class="indexentry" index-key="runnable documentation (assertions as);assertion!as runnable documentation" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#runnable_documentation" markdown="1">runnable documentation</a></span>
to tell the next programmer more about the code.
Regular code tells the computer what to do;
assertions with meaningful error messages tell the reader why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can fix our problem by rewriting the rule loader
to separate pattern rules from simple rules;
we can tell the two apart by checking if the rule's dependencies include <code>%</code>.
While we're here,
we will enable timestamps as an optional field in the rules for testing purposes
rather than having them in a separate file:</p>

<h2 id="build-manager-next">Section 10.6:  What should we do next?</h2>
<p>We have added a lot of steps to our original template method,
which makes it a bit of a stretch to claim that the overall operation hasn't changed.
Knowing what we know now,
we could go back and modify the original <code>SkeletonBuilder.build</code> method
to include those extra steps and provide do-nothing implementations.</p>
<p>The root of the problem is that we didn't anticipate all the steps that would be involved
when we wrote our template method.
It typically takes a few child classes for this to settle down;
if it never does,
then <span class="indexentry" index-key="Template Method pattern;design pattern!Template Method" markdown="1">Template Method</span> is probably the wrong pattern for our situation.
Realizing this isn't a failure in initial design:
we always learn about our problem as we try to capture it in code,
and if we know enough to anticipate 100% of the issues that are going to come up,
it's time to put what we've learned in a library for future use.</p>
<div class="break-before"></div>
<h2 id="build-manager-exercises">Section 10.7:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">Handle failure</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the build manager to accommodate build steps that fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write Mocha tests to check that this change works correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Dry run</h3>
<p>Add an option to the build manager to show what commands would be executed and why
if a build were actually run.
For example,
the output should display things like, "'update A' because A older than B".</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Change directories</h3>
<p>Modify the build manager so that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node build.js -C some/sub/directory rules.yml timestamps.yml
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">runs the build in the specified directory rather than the current directory.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Merge files</h3>
<p>Modify the build manager so that it can read multiple configuration files
and execute their combined rules.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Show recipes</h3>
<p>Add a method to build manager to display all unique recipes,
i.e.,
all of the commands it might execute if asked to rebuild everything.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Conditional execution</h3>
<p>Modify the build manager so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user can pass <code>variable=true</code> and <code>variable=false</code> arguments on the command-line
    to define variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules can contain an <code>if: variable</code> field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those rules are only executed if the variable is defined and true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write Mocha tests to check that this works correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Define filesets</h3>
<p>Modify the build manager so that users can define sets of files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">fileset:
  name: everything
  contains:
    - X
    - Y
    - Z
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and then refer to them later:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">- target: P
  depends:
  - @everything
</code></pre>
<h3 class="exercise">Globbing</h3>
<p>Modify the build manager so that it can dynamically construct a set of files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">glob:
  name: allAvailableInputs
  pattern: "./*.in"
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and then refer to them later:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">- target: P
  depends:
  - @allAvailableInputs
</code></pre>
<h3 class="exercise">Use hashes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a program called <code>build-init.js</code> that calculates a hash
    for every file mentioned in the build configuration
    and stores the hash along with the file's name in <code>build-hash.json</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the build manager to compare the current hashes of files
    with those stored in <code>build-hash.json</code>
    in order to determine what is out of date,
    and to update <code>build-hash.json</code> each time it runs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Auxiliary functions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the builder manager so that it takes an extra argument <code>auxiliaries</code>
    containing zero or more named functions:</p>
<p><code>js
const builder = new ExtensibleBuilder(configFile, timesFile, {
  slice: (node, graph) =&gt; simplify(node, graph, 1)
})</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the <code>run</code> method to call these functions
    before executing the rules for a node,
    and to only execute the rules if all of them return <code>true</code>.</p>

In all three cases,
a <span class="indexentry" index-key="layout engine" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#layout_engine" markdown="1">layout engine</a></span> took some text and some layout instructions

to explore how browsers decide what to put where.</p>
<p>Our inputs will be a very small subset of HTML and an equally small subset of CSS.
We will create our own classes to represent these
instead of using those provided by various <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> libraries;
to translate the combination of HTML and CSS into text on the screen,
we will label each node in the DOM tree with the appropriate styles,
walk that tree to figure out where each visible element belongs,

<h2 id="layout-engine-size">Section 11.1:  How can we size rows and columns?</h2>
<p>Let's start on <a class="glossref" href="#easy_mode" markdown="1">easy mode</a>
without margins, padding, line-wrapping, or other complications.
Everything we can put on the screen is represented as a rectangular cell,
and every cell is either a row, a column, or a block.
A block has a fixed width and height:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class Block {
  constructor (width, height) {
    this.width = width
    this.height = height
  }

  getWidth () {
    return this.width
  }

  getHeight () {
    return this.height
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A row arranges one or more cells horizontally;
its width is the sum of the widths of its children,
while its height is the height of its tallest child
(<a class="figref" href="../layout-engine/#layout-engine-sizing">Figure 11.2</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class Row {
  constructor (...children) {
    this.children = children
  }

  getWidth () {
    let result = 0
    for (const child of this.children) {
      result += child.getWidth()
    }
    return result
  }

  getHeight () {
    let result = 0
    for (const child of this.children) {
      result = Math.max(result, child.getHeight())
    }
    return result
  }
}
</code></pre>
<figure id="layout-engine-sizing">
<img alt="Calculating sizes of fixed blocks" src="./layout-engine/figures/sizing.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 11.2: Calculating sizes of blocks with fixed width and height.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally,
a column arranges one or more cells vertically;
its width is the width of its widest child
and its height is the sum of the heights of its children.
(Here and elsewhere we use the abbreviation <code>col</code> when referring to columns.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class Col {
  constructor (...children) {
    this.children = children
  }

  getWidth () {
    let result = 0
    for (const child of this.children) {
      result = Math.max(result, child.getWidth())
    }
    return result
  }

  getHeight () {
    let result = 0
    for (const child of this.children) {
      result += child.getHeight()
    }
    return result
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rows and columns nest inside one another:
a row cannot span two or more columns,
and a column cannot cross the boundary between two rows.
Any time we have a structure with that property
we can represent it as a tree of nested objects.
Given such a tree,
we can calculate the width and height of each cell every time we need to.
This is simple but inefficient:
we could calculate both width and height at the same time
and <span class="indexentry" index-key="cache!calculated values" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#cache" markdown="1">cache</a></span> those values to avoid recalculation,
but we called this "easy mode" for a reason.</p>
<p>As simple as it is,
this code could still contain errors (and did during development),
so we write some <span class="indexentry" index-key="Mocha" markdown="1"><a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a></span> tests to check that it works as desired
before trying to build anything more complicated:</p>

<h2 id="layout-engine-position">Section 11.2:  How can we position rows and columns?</h2>
<p>Now that we know how big each cell is
we can figure out where to put it.
Suppose we start with the upper left corner of the browser:
upper because we lay out the page top-to-bottom
and left because we are doing left-to-right layout.
If the cell is a block, we place it there.
If the cell is a row, on the other hand,
we get its height
and then calculate its lower edge as y1 = y0 + height.
We then place the first child's lower-left corner at (x0, y1),
the second child's at (x0 + width0, y1), and so on
(<a class="figref" href="../layout-engine/#layout-engine-layout">Figure 11.3</a>).
Similarly,
if the cell is a column
we place the first child at (x0, y0),
the next at (x0, y0 + height0),
and so on.</p>

<h2 id="layout-engine-render">Section 11.3:  How can we render elements?</h2>
<p>We drew the blocks on a piece of graph paper
in order to figure out the expected answers for the tests shown above.
We can do something similar in software by creating a "screen" of space characters
and then having each block draw itself in the right place.
If we do this starting at the root of the tree,
child blocks will overwrite the markings made by their parents,
which will automatically produce the right appearance
(<a class="figref" href="../layout-engine/#layout-engine-draw-over">Figure 11.4</a>).
(A more sophisticated version of this called <a class="glossref" href="#z_buffering" markdown="1">z-buffering</a>
keeps track of the visual depth of each pixel
in order to draw things in three dimensions.)</p>
<figure id="layout-engine-draw-over">
<img alt="Children drawing over their parents" src="./layout-engine/figures/draw-over.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 11.4: Render blocks by drawing child nodes on top of parent nodes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our pretended screen is just an array of arrays of characters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const makeScreen = (width, height) =&gt; {
  const screen = []
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; height; i += 1) {
    screen.push(new Array(width).fill(' '))
  }
  return screen
}
</code></pre>
<p>We will use successive lower-case characters to show each block,
i.e.,
the root block will draw itself using 'a',
while its children will be 'b', 'c', and so on.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const draw = (screen, node, fill = null) =&gt; {
  fill = nextFill(fill)
  node.render(screen, fill)
  if ('children' in node) {
    node.children.forEach(child =&gt; {
      fill = draw(screen, child, fill)
    })
  }
  return fill
}

const nextFill = (fill) =&gt; {
  return (fill === null)
    ? 'a'
    : String.fromCharCode(fill.charCodeAt() + 1)
}
</code></pre>
<p>To teach each kind of cell how to render itself,
we have to derive a new class from each of the ones we have
and give the new class a <code>render</code> method with the same <span class="indexentry" index-key="signature!of function;function signature" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#signature" markdown="1">signature</a></span>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {
  PlacedBlock,
  PlacedCol,
  PlacedRow
} from './placed.js'

// [keep]
export class RenderedBlock extends PlacedBlock {
  render (screen, fill) {
    drawBlock(screen, this, fill)
  }
}

export class RenderedCol extends PlacedCol {
  render (screen, fill) {
    drawBlock(screen, this, fill)
  }
}

export class RenderedRow extends PlacedRow {
  render (screen, fill) {
    drawBlock(screen, this, fill)
  }
}

const drawBlock = (screen, node, fill) =&gt; {
  for (let ix = 0; ix &lt; node.getWidth(); ix += 1) {
    for (let iy = 0; iy &lt; node.getHeight(); iy += 1) {
      screen[node.y0 + iy][node.x0 + ix] = fill
    }
  }
}
// [/keep]
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">These <code>render</code> methods do exactly the same thing,
so we have each one call a shared function that does the actual work.
If we were building a real layout engine,
a cleaner solution would be to go back and create a class called <code>Cell</code> with this <code>render</code> method,
then derive our <code>Block</code>, <code>Row</code>, and <code>Col</code> classes from that.
In general,
if two or more classes need to be able to do something,
we should add a method to do that to their lowest common ancestor.</p>
<p>Our simpler tests are a little easier to read once we have rendering in place,
though we still had to draw things on paper to figure out our complex ones:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  it('renders a grid of rows of columns', async () =&gt; {
    const fixture = new Col(
      new Row(
        new Block(1, 2),
        new Block(3, 4)
      ),
      new Row(
        new Block(1, 2),
        new Col(
          new Block(3, 4),
          new Block(2, 3)
        )
      )
    )
    fixture.place(0, 0)
    assert.deepStrictEqual(
      render(fixture),
      [
        'bddd',
        'bddd',
        'cddd',
        'cddd',
        'ehhh',
        'ehhh',
        'ehhh',
        'ehhh',
        'eiig',
        'fiig',
        'fiig'
      ].join('\n')
    )
  })
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The fact that we find our own tests difficult to understand
is a sign that we should do more testing.
It would be very easy for us to get a wrong result
and convince ourselves that it was actually correct;
<span class="indexentry" index-key="confirmation bias" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#confirmation_bias" markdown="1">confirmation bias</a></span> of this kind
is very common in software development.</p>
<h2 id="layout-engine-fit">Section 11.4:  How can we wrap elements to fit?</h2>
<p>One of the biggest differences between a browser and a printed page
is that the text in the browser wraps itself automatically as the window is resized.
(The other, these days, is that the printed page doesn't spy on us,
though someone is undoubtedly working on that.)</p>
<p>To add wrapping to our layout engine,
suppose we fix the width of a row.
If the total width of the children is greater than the row's width,
the layout engine needs to wrap the children around.
This assumes that columns can be made as big as they need to be,
i.e.,
that we can grow vertically to make up for limited space horizontally.
It also assumes that all of the row's children are no wider than the width of the row;
we will look at what happens when they're not in the exercises.</p>
<p>Our layout engine manages wrapping by transforming the tree.
The height and width of blocks are fixed,
so they become themselves.
Columns become themselves as well,
but since they have children that might need to wrap,
the class representing columns needs a new method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class WrappedBlock extends PlacedBlock {
  wrap () {
    return this
  }
}

export class WrappedCol extends PlacedCol {
  wrap () {
    const children = this.children.map(child =&gt; child.wrap())
    return new PlacedCol(...children)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rows do all the hard work.
Each original row is replaced with a new row that contains a single column with one or more rows,
each of which is one "line" of wrapped cells
(<a class="figref" href="../layout-engine/#layout-engine-wrap">Figure 11.5</a>).
This replacement is unnecessary when everything will fit on a single row,
but it's easiest to write the code that does it every time;
we will look at making this more efficient in the exercises.</p>
<figure id="layout-engine-wrap">
<img alt="Wrapping rows" src="./layout-engine/figures/wrap.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 11.5: Wrapping rows by introducing a new row and column.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our new wrappable row's constructor takes a fixed width followed by the children
and returns that fixed width when asked for its size:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class WrappedRow extends PlacedRow {
  constructor (width, ...children) {
    super(...children)
    assert(width &gt;= 0,
      'Need non-negative width')
    this.width = width
  }

  getWidth () {
    return this.width
  }

}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Wrapping puts the row's children into buckets,
then converts the buckets to a row of a column of rows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  wrap () {
    const children = this.children.map(child =&gt; child.wrap())
    const rows = []
    let currentRow = []
    let currentX = 0

    children.forEach(child =&gt; {
      const childWidth = child.getWidth()
      if ((currentX + childWidth) &lt;= this.width) {
        currentRow.push(child)
        currentX += childWidth
      } else {
        rows.push(currentRow)
        currentRow = [child]
        currentX = childWidth
      }
    })
    rows.push(currentRow)

    const newCol = new PlacedCol(...newRows)
    return new PlacedRow(newCol)

<h3>The Liskov Substitution Principle</h3>
<p>We are able to re-use tests like this because of
the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Liskov Substitution Principle;software design!Liskov Substitution Principle" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#liskov_substitution_principle" markdown="1">Liskov Substitution Principle</a></span>,
which states that
it should be possible to replace objects in a program
with objects of derived classes
without breaking anything.
In order to satisfy this principle,
new code must handle the same set of inputs as the old code,
though it may be able to process more inputs as well.
Conversely,
its output must be a subset of what the old code produced
so that whatever is downstream from it won't be surprised.
Thinking in these terms leads to a methodology called

<h2 id="layout-engine-css">Section 11.5:  What subset of CSS will we support?</h2>
<p>It's finally time to style pages that contain text.
Our final subset of HTML has rows, columns, and text blocks as before.
Each text block has one or more lines of text;
the number of lines determines the block's height
and the length of the longest line determines its width.</p>
<p>Rows and columns can have <a class="glossref" href="#attribute" markdown="1">attributes</a> just as they can in real HTML,
and each attribute must have a single value in quotes.
Rows no longer take a fixed width:

<p>The next step is to define a generic class for CSS rules
with a subclass for each type of rule.
From highest precedence to lowest,
the three types of rules we support identify specific nodes via their ID,
classes of nodes via their <code>class</code> attribute,
and types of nodes via their element name.
We keep track of which rules take precedence over which through the simple expedient of numbering the classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class CssRule {
  constructor (order, selector, styles) {
    this.order = order
    this.selector = selector
    this.styles = styles
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>An ID rule's <span class="indexentry" index-key="query selector" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#query_selector" markdown="1">query selector</a></span> is written as <code>#name</code>
and matches HTML like <code>&lt;tag id="name"&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt;</code> (where <code>tag</code> is <code>row</code> or <code>col</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class IdRule extends CssRule {
  constructor (selector, styles) {
    assert(selector.startsWith('#') &amp;&amp; (selector.length &gt; 1),
      `ID rule ${selector} must start with # and have a selector`)
    super(IdRule.ORDER, selector.slice(1), styles)
  }

  match (node) {
    return ('attributes' in node) &amp;&amp;
      ('id' in node.attributes) &amp;&amp;
      (node.attributes.id === this.selector)
  }
}
IdRule.ORDER = 0
</code></pre>
<p>A class rule's query selector is written as <code>.kind</code> and matches HTML like <code>&lt;tag class="kind"&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt;</code>.
Unlike real CSS,
we only allow one class per node:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class ClassRule extends CssRule {
  constructor (selector, styles) {
    assert(selector.startsWith('.') &amp;&amp; (selector.length &gt; 1),
      `Class rule ${selector} must start with . and have a selector`)
    super(ClassRule.ORDER, selector.slice(1), styles)
  }

  match (node) {
    return ('attributes' in node) &amp;&amp;
      ('class' in node.attributes) &amp;&amp;
      (node.attributes.class === this.selector)
  }
}
ClassRule.ORDER = 1
</code></pre>
<p>Finally,
tag rules just have the name of the type of node they apply to without any punctuation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class TagRule extends CssRule {
  constructor (selector, styles) {
    super(TagRule.ORDER, selector, styles)
  }

  match (node) {
    return this.selector === node.tag
  }
}
TagRule.ORDER = 2
</code></pre>
<p>We could build yet another parser to read a subset of CSS and convert it to objects,
but this chapter is long enough,
so we will write our rules as JSON:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{
  'row': { width: 20 },
  '.kind': { width: 5 },
  '#name': { height: 10 }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and build a class that converts this representation to a set of objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class CssRuleSet {
  constructor (json, mergeDefaults = true) {
    this.rules = this.jsonToRules(json)
  }

    return sorted
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our CSS ruleset class also has a method for finding the rules for a given DOM node.
This method relies on the precedence values we defined for our classes
in order to sort them
so that we can find the most specific.</p>
<p>Here's our final set of tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  it('styles a tree of nodes with multiple rules', async () =&gt; {
    const html = [
      '&lt;col id="name"&gt;',
      '&lt;row class="kind"&gt;first\nsecond&lt;/row&gt;',
      '&lt;row&gt;third\nfourth&lt;/row&gt;',
      '&lt;/col&gt;'
    ]
    const dom = parseHTML(html.join(''))
    const rules = new CssRuleSet({
      '.kind': { height: 3 },
      '#name': { height: 5 },
      row: { width: 10 }
    })
    dom.findRules(rules)
    assert.deepStrictEqual(dom.rules, [
      new IdRule('#name', { height: 5 })
    ])
    assert.deepStrictEqual(dom.children[0].rules, [
      new ClassRule('.kind', { height: 3 }),
      new TagRule('row', { width: 10 })
    ])
    assert.deepStrictEqual(dom.children[1].rules, [
      new TagRule('row', { width: 10 })
    ])
  })
</code></pre>
<p>If we were going on,
we would override the cells' <code>getWidth</code> and <code>getHeight</code> methods to pay attention to styles.
We would also decide what to do with cells that don't have any styles defined:
use a default,
flag it as an error,
or make a choice based on the contents of the child nodes.
We will explore these possibilities in the exercises.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Where it all started</h3>
<p>This chapter's topic was one of the seeds from which this entire book grew
(the other being debuggers discussed in <a class="crossref" href="#debugger">Chapter 20</a>).
After struggling with <span class="indexentry" index-key="CSS!struggles with" markdown="1">CSS</span> for several years,
<span class="indexentry" index-key="Wilson, Greg" markdown="1"><a href="https://third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a></span> began wondering whether it really had to be so complicated.
That question led to others,
which eventually led to all of this.
The moral is,
be careful what you ask.</p>

<div class="break-before"></div>
<h2 id="layout-engine-exercises">Section 11.6:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">Refactoring the node classes</h3>
<p>Refactor the classes used to represent blocks, rows, and columns so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They all derive from a common parent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All common behavior is defined in that parent (if only with placeholder methods).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Handling rule conflicts</h3>
<p>Modify the rule lookup mechanism so that if two conflicting rules are defined,
the one that is defined second takes precedence.
For example,
if there are two definitions for <code>row.bold</code>,
whichever comes last in the JSON representation of the CSS wins.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Handling arbitrary tags</h3>
<p>Modify the existing code to handle arbitrary HTML elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The parser should recognize <code>&lt;anyTag&gt;...&lt;/anyTag&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of separate classes for rows and columns,
    there should be one class <code>Node</code> whose <code>tag</code> attribute identifies its type.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Recycling nodes</h3>
<p>Modify the wrapping code so that new rows and columns are only created if needed.
For example,
if a row of width 10 contains a text node with the string "fits",
a new row and column are <em>not</em> inserted.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Rendering a clear background</h3>
<p>Modify the rendering code so that only the text in block nodes is shown,
i.e.,
so that the empty space in rows and columns is rendered as spaces.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Clipping text</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the wrapping and rendering so that
    if a block of text is too wide for the available space
    the extra characters are clipped.
    For example,
    if a column of width 5 contains a line "unfittable",
    only "unfit" appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend your solution to break lines on spaces as needed
    in order to avoid clipping.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Bidirectional rendering</h3>
<p>Modify the existing software to do either left-to-right or right-to-left rendering
upon request.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Equal sizing</h3>
<p>Modify the existing code to support elastic columns,
i.e.,
so that all of the columns in a row are automatically sized to have the same width.
If the number of columns does not divide evenly into the width of the row,
allocate the extra space as equally as possible from left to right.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Padding elements</h3>
<p>Modify the existing code so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Authors can define a <code>padding</code> attribute for row and column elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the node is rendered, that many blank spaces are added on all four sides of the contents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="continue">For example, the HTML <code>&lt;row&gt;text&lt;/row&gt;</code> would render as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">+------+
|      |
| text |
|      |
+------+
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">where the lines show the outer border of the rendering.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Drawing borders</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the existing code so that elements may specify <code>border: true</code> or <code>border: false</code>
    (with the latter being the default).
    If an element's <code>border</code> property is <code>true</code>,
    it is drawn with a dashed border.
    For example,
    if the <code>border</code> property of <code>row</code> is <code>true</code>,
    then <code>&lt;row&gt;text&lt;/row&gt;</code> is rendered as:</p>
<p><code>txt
+----+
|text|
+----+</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend your solution so that if two adjacent cells both have borders,
    only a single border is drawn.
    For example,
    if the <code>border</code> property of <code>col</code> is <code>true</code>,
    then:</p>
<p><code>html
&lt;row&gt;&lt;col&gt;left&lt;/col&gt;&lt;col&gt;right&lt;/col&gt;&lt;/row&gt;</code></p>
<p class="continue">is rendered as:</p>
<p><code>txt
+----+-----+
|left|right|
+----+-----+</code></p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of the examples in these lessons are too long
to show comfortably in one block of code on a printed page,
so we needed a way to break them up.
As an experiment,
we wrote a custom <span class="indexentry" index-key="module loader" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#loader" markdown="1">module loader</a></span>
that reads a source file containing specially-formatted comments
and then reads and inserts the files specified in those comments
before running the code
(<a class="figref" href="../file-interpolator/#file-interpolator-conceptual">Figure 12.1</a>).
Modern programming languages don't work this way,
but <span class="indexentry" index-key="C" markdown="1">C</span> and <span class="indexentry" index-key="C++" markdown="1">C++</span> do this
with <span class="indexentry" index-key="header file!in C and C++" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#header_file" markdown="1">header files</a></span>,
and <span class="indexentry" index-key="static site generator!header file;header file!static site generator" markdown="1">static site generators</span>
(<a class="crossref" href="#page-templates">Chapter 9</a>) do this to share fragments of HTML.</p>
<figure id="file-interpolator-conceptual">
<img alt="Using file inclusions" src="./file-interpolator/figures/conceptual.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 12.1: Including fragments of code to create runnable programs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The special comments in our source files contain two fields:
the text to put in the displayed version
and file to include when loading:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
class Something {
  /*+ constructor + constructor.js +*/

  /*+ a long method + long_method.js +*/

  /*+ another method + another_method.js +*/
}
</code></pre>
<p>We got this to work,
but decided to use a different approach in this book.
The stumbling block was that the style-checking tool <span class="indexentry" index-key="ESLint" markdown="1"><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a></span>
didn't know what to make of our inclusions,
so we would either have to modify it or build a style checker of our own.
(We will actually do that in <a class="crossref" href="#style-checker">Chapter 14</a>,
but we won't go nearly as far as ESLint.)</p>
<p>Despite being a dead end,
the inclusion tool is a good way to show
how JavaScript turns source code into something it can execute.
We need to be able to do this in the next couple of chapters,
so we might as well tackle it now.</p>
<h2 id="file-interpolator-dynamic">Section 12.1:  How can we evaluate JavaScript dynamically?</h2>
<p>We want to display files as they are on the web and in print,
but interpolate the files referenced in special comments
when we load things with <code>import</code>.
To do this,
we need to understand the lifecycle of a JavaScript program.
When we ask for a file,
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> reads the text,
translates it into runnable instructions,
and runs those instructions.
We can do the second and third steps whenever we want using a function called <code>eval</code>,
which takes a string as input and executes it as if it were part of the program
(<a class="figref" href="../file-interpolator/#file-interpolator-eval">Figure 12.2</a>).</p>
<figure id="file-interpolator-eval">
<img alt="How eval works" src="./file-interpolator/figures/eval.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 12.2: `eval` vs. normal translation and execution.</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<h3>This is not a good idea</h3>
<p><span class="indexentry" index-key="eval!insecurity of" markdown="1"><code>eval</code></span> is a security risk:
arbitrary code can do arbitrary things,
so if we take a string typed in by a user and execute it without any checks
it could email our bookmark list to villains all over the world,
erase our hard drive,
or do anything else that code can do (which is pretty much anything).
Browsers do their best to run code in a <span class="indexentry" index-key="sandbox (for safe execution)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#sandbox" markdown="1">sandbox</a></span> for safety,
but Node doesn't,
so it's up to us to be (very) careful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see <code>eval</code> in action,
let's evaluate an expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable no-eval */
console.log(eval('2 + 2'))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">4
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Notice that the input to <code>eval</code> is <em>not</em> <code>2 + 2</code>,
but rather a string containing the digit 2,
a space,
a plus sign,
another space,
and another 2.
When we call <code>eval</code>,
it translates this string
using exactly the same parser that Node uses for our program
and immediately runs the result.</p>
<p>We can make the example a little more interesting
by constructing the string dynamically:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable no-eval */
const x = 1 // eslint-disable-line
const y = 3 // eslint-disable-line
const z = 5 // eslint-disable-line
for (const name of ['x', 'y', 'z', 'oops']) {
  const expr = `${name} + 1`
  console.log(name, '+ 1 =', eval(expr))
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">x + 1 = 2
y + 1 = 4
z + 1 = 6
undefined:1
oops + 1
^

</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The first time the loop runs the string is <code>'x + 1'</code>;
since there's a variable called <code>x</code> in scope,
<code>eval</code> does the addition and we print the result.
The same thing happens for the variables <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>,
but we get an error when we try to evaluate the string <code>'oops + 1'</code>
because there is no variable in scope called <code>oops</code>.</p>
<p><code>eval</code> can use whatever variables are in scope when it's called,
but what happens to any variables it defines?
This example creates a variable called <code>x</code> and runs <code>console.log</code> to display it,
but as the output shows,
<code>x</code> is local to the <code>eval</code> call
just as variables created inside a function
only exist during a call to that function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable no-eval */
const code = `
  const x = 'hello'
  console.log('x in eval is', x)
`

eval(code)
console.log('typeof x after eval', typeof x)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">x in eval is hello
typeof x after eval undefined
</code></pre>
<p>However,
<code>eval</code> can modify variables defined outside the text being evaluated
in the same way that a function can modify global variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable no-eval */
let x = 'original' // eslint-disable-line
eval('x = "modified"')
console.log('x after eval is', x)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">x after eval is modified
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">This means that
if the text we give to <code>eval</code> modifies a structure that is defined outside the text,
that change outlives the call to <code>eval</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable no-eval */
const seen = {}

for (const name of ['x', 'y', 'z']) {
  const expr = `seen["${name}"] = "${name.toUpperCase()}"`
  eval(expr)
}

console.log(seen)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">{ x: 'X', y: 'Y', z: 'Z' }
</code></pre>
<p>The examples so far have all evaluated strings embedded in the program itself,
but <code>eval</code> doesn't care where its input comes from.
Let's move the code that does the modifying into <code>to-be-loaded.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
// Modify a global structure defined by whoever loads us.
Seen.from_loaded_file = 'from loaded file'
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">This doesn't work on its own because <code>Seen</code> isn't defined:</p>

<h2 id="file-interpolator-manage">Section 12.2:  How can we manage files?</h2>
<p>The source files in this book are small enough
that we don't have to worry about reading them repeatedly,
but we would like to avoid re-reading things unnecessarily
in large systems or when there might be network delays.
The usual approach is to create a <span class="indexentry" index-key="cache!of loaded files" markdown="1">cache</span>
using the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Singleton pattern;design pattern!Singleton" markdown="1">Singleton pattern</span>
that we first met in <a class="crossref" href="#unit-test">Chapter 4</a>.
Whenever we want to read a file,
we check to see if it's already in the cache
(<a class="figref" href="../file-interpolator/#file-interpolator-cache">Figure 12.3</a>).
If it is,
we use that copy;
if not,
we read it and add it to the cache
using the file path as a lookup key.</p>
<figure id="file-interpolator-cache">
<img alt="Implementing a cache as a singleton" src="./file-interpolator/figures/cache.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 12.3: Using the Singleton pattern to implement a cache of loaded files.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can write a simple cache in just a few lines of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable no-eval */
import fs from 'fs'

class Cache {
  constructor () {
    this.loaded = new Map()
  }

  need (name) {
    if (this.loaded.has(name)) {
      console.log(`returning cached value for ${name}`)
      return this.loaded.get(name)
    }
    console.log(`loading ${name}`)
    const content = fs.readFileSync(name, 'utf-8')
    const result = eval(content)
    this.loaded.set(name, result)
    return result
  }
}

const cache = new Cache()

export default (name) =&gt; {
  return cache.need(name)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since we are using <code>eval</code>, though,
we can't rely on <code>export</code> to make things available to the rest of the program.
Instead,
we rely on the fact that the result of an <code>eval</code> call is the value of
the last expression evaluated.
Since a variable name on its own evaluates to the variable's value,
we can create a function and then use its name
to "export" it from the evaluated file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
// Define.
const report = (message) =&gt; {
  console.log(`report in import-01.js with message "${message}"`)
}

// Export.
report
</code></pre>
<p>To test our program,
we load the implementation of the cache using <code>import</code>,
then use it to load and evaluate another file.
This example expects that "other file" to define a function,
which we call in order to show that everything is working:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import need from './need-simple.js'

const imported = need('./import-simple.js')
imported('called from test-simple.js')
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node test-simple.js
</code></pre>
<h2 id="file-interpolator-find">Section 12.3:  How can we find files?</h2>
<p>Each of the files included in our examples is in the same directory as the file including it,
but in C/C++ or a page templating system
we might include a particular file in several different places.
We don't want to have to put all of our files in a single directory,
so we need a way specify where to look for files that are being included.</p>
<p>One option is to use relative paths,
but another option is to give our program
a list of directories to look in.
This is called a <span class="indexentry" index-key="search path" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#search_path" markdown="1">search path</a></span>,
and many programs use them,
including Node itself.
By convention,
a search path is written as a colon-separated list of directories on Unix
or using semi-colons on Windows.
If the path to an included starts with <code>./</code>,
we look for it locally;
if not,
we go through the directories in the search path in order
until we find a file with a matching name
(<a class="figref" href="../file-interpolator/#file-interpolator-search-path">Figure 12.4</a>).</p>
<figure id="file-interpolator-search-path">
<img alt="Implementing a search path" src="./file-interpolator/figures/search-path.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 12.4: Using a colon-separated list of directories as a search path.</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<h3>That's just how it is</h3>
<p>The rules about search paths in the paragraph above are a convention:
somebody did it this way years ago
and (almost) everyone has imitated it since.
We could implement search paths some other way,
but as with configuration file formats,
variable naming conventions,
and many other things,
the last thing the world needs is more innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the cache is responsible for finding files,
it should also handle the search path.
The outline of the class stays the same:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable no-eval */
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'

class Cache {
  constructor () {
    this.loaded = new Map()
    this.constructSearchPath()
  }

  need (fileSpec) {
    if (this.loaded.has(fileSpec)) {
      console.log(`returning cached value for ${fileSpec}`)
      return this.loaded.get(fileSpec)
    }
    console.log(`loading value for ${fileSpec}`)
    const filePath = this.find(fileSpec)
    const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')
    const result = eval(content)
    this.loaded.set(fileSpec, result)
    return result
  }

}

const cache = new Cache()

export default (fileSpec) =&gt; {
  return cache.need(fileSpec)
}
</code></pre>
<p>To get the search path,
we look for the <span class="indexentry" index-key="shell variable (for storing search path);search path!shell variable" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#shell_variable" markdown="1">shell variable</a></span> <code>NEED_PATH</code>.
(Writing shell variables' names in upper case is another convention.)
If <code>NEED_PATH</code> exists,
we split it on colons to create a list of directories:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  constructSearchPath () {
    this.searchPath = []
    if ('NEED_PATH' in process.env) {
      this.searchPath = process.env.NEED_PATH
        .split(':')
        .filter(x =&gt; x.length &gt; 0)
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>When we need to find a file we first check to see if the path is local.
If it's not,
we try the directories in the search path in order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  constructSearchPath () {
    this.searchPath = []
    if ('NEED_PATH' in process.env) {
      this.searchPath = process.env.NEED_PATH
        .split(':')
        .filter(x =&gt; x.length &gt; 0)
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>To test this,
we put the file to import in a subdirectory called <code>modules</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
// Define.
const report = (message) =&gt; {
  console.log(`in LEFT with message "${message}"`)
}

// Export.
report
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and then put the file doing the importing in the current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import need from './need-path.js'
const imported = need('imported-left.js')
imported('called from test-import-left.js')
</code></pre>
<p>We now need to set the variable <code>NEED_PATH</code>.
There are many ways to do this in shell;
if we only need the variable to exist for a single command,
the simplest is to write it as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">NAME=value command
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">right before the command (on the same line).
Here's the shell command that runs our test case
using <code>$PWD</code> to get the current working directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">NEED_PATH=$PWD/modules/ node test-import-left.js
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">loading value for imported-left.js
trying /u/stjs/file-interpolator/modules/imported-left.js for \
imported-left.js
in LEFT with message "called from test-import-left.js"
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's create a second importable file in the <code>modules</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
// Define.
const report = (message) =&gt; {
  console.log(`in RIGHT with message "${message}"`)
}

// Export.
report
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and load that twice to check that caching works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import need from './need-path.js'

const imported = need('imported-right.js')
imported('called from test-import-right.js')

const alsoImported = need('imported-right.js')
alsoImported('called from test-import-right.js')
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">loading value for imported-right.js

imported-right.js
in RIGHT with message "called from test-import-right.js"

<h2 id="file-interpolator-interpolate">Section 12.4:  How can we interpolate pieces of code?</h2>
<p>Interpolating files is straightforward once we have this machinery in place.
We modify <code>Cache.find</code> to return a directory and a file path,
then add an <code>interpolate</code> method to replace special comments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
class Cache {
  // ...
  interpolate (fileDir, outer) {
    return outer.replace(Cache.INTERPOLATE_PAT,
                         (match, comment, filename) =&gt; {
      filename = filename.trim()
      const filePath = path.join(fileDir, filename)
      if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
        throw new Error(`Cannot find ${filePath}`)
      }
      const inner = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')
      return inner
    })
  }
  // ...
}
Cache.INTERPOLATE_PAT = /\/\*\+(.+?)\+(.+?)\+\*\//g
</code></pre>
<p>We can now have a file like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
class Example {
  constructor (msg) {
    this.constructorMessage = msg
  }
  /*+ top method + import-interpolate-topmethod.js +*/
  /*+ bottom method + import-interpolate-bottommethod.js +*/
}

Example
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and subfiles like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
topMethod (msg) {
  this.bottomMethod(`(topMethod ${msg})`)
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */
bottomMethod (msg) {
  console.log(`(bottomMethod ${msg})`)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's test it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node test-import-interpolate.js
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">(bottomMethod (topMethod called from test-import-interpolate.js))
</code></pre>
<p>When this program runs, its <span class="indexentry" index-key="lifecycle!of file interpolation" markdown="1">lifecycle</span> is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Node starts to run <code>test-import-interpolate.js</code>.</li>
<li>It sees the <code>import</code> of need-interpolate` so it reads and evaluates that code.</li>
<li>Doing this creates a singleton cache object.</li>
<li>The program then calls <code>need('./import-interpolate.js')</code>.</li>
<li>This checks the cache: nope, nothing there.</li>
<li>So it loads <code>import-interpolate.js</code>.</li>
<li>It finds two specially-formatted comments in the text…</li>
<li>…so it loads the file described by each one and inserts the text in place of the comment.</li>
<li>Now that it has the complete text, it calls <code>eval</code>…</li>
<li>…and stores the result of <code>eval</code> (which is a class) in the cache.</li>
<li>It also returns that class.</li>
<li>We then create an instance of that class and call its method.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works,
but as we said in the introduction we decided not to use it
because it didn't play well with other tools.
No piece of software exists in isolation;
when we evaluate a design,
we always have to ask how it fits into everything else we have.</p>
<h2 id="file-interpolator-instead">Section 12.5:  What did we do instead?</h2>
<p>Rather than interpolating file fragments,
we extract or erase parts of regular JavaScript files
based on specially-formatted comments
like the <code>&lt;fragment&gt;...&lt;/fragment&gt;</code> pair shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Example {
  constructor (name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  // &lt;fragment&gt;
  fragment (message) {
    console.log(`${name}: ${message}`)
  }
  // &lt;/fragment&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code that selects the part of the file we want to display
is part of our page templating system.
It re-extracts code for display every time the web version of this site is built,
which ensures that we always shows what's in the current version of our examples.
However,
this system doesn't automatically update the description of the code:
if we write, "It does X,"
then modify the code to do Y,
our lesson can be inconsistent.

<h2 id="file-interpolator-exercises">Section 12.6:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">Security concerns</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a function <code>loadAndRun</code> that reads a file, evaluates it, and returns the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a file <code>trust-me.js</code> that prints "nothing happening here" when it is evaluated,
    but also deletes everything in the directory called <code>target</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write tests for this using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-fs"><code>mock-fs</code></a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="continue">Please be careful doing this exercise.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Loading functions</h3>
<p>Write a function that reads a file containing single-argument functions like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">addOne: (x) =&gt; x + 1
halve: (x) =&gt; x / 2
array: (x) =&gt; Array(x).fill(0)
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and returns an object containing callable functions.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Registering functions</h3>
<p>Write a function that loads one or more files containing function definitions like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const double = (x) =&gt; {
  return 2 * x
}

EXPORTS.append(double)
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and returns a list containing all the loaded functions.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Indenting inclusions</h3>
<p>Modify the file inclusion system
so that inclusions are indented by the same amount as the including comment.
For example,
if the including file is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const withLogging = (args) =&gt; {
  /*+ logging call + logging.js +*/
}

withLogging
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and the included file is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">console.log('first message')
console.log('second message')
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">then the result will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const withLogging = (args) =&gt; {
  console.log('first message')
  console.log('second message')
}

withLogging
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">i.e., all lines of the inclusion will be indented to match the first.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Interpolating from subdirectories</h3>
<p>Modify the file interpolator so that snippets can be included from sub-directories using relative paths.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Recursive search for inclusions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the file interpolator so that it searches recursively
    through all subdirectories of the directories on the search path
    to find inclusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain why this is a bad idea.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Defining variables</h3>
<p>Modify the file inclusion system so that users can pass in a <code>Map</code> containing name-value pairs
and have these interpolated into the text of the files being loaded.
To interpolate a value,
the included file must use <code>@@name@@</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Specifying markers</h3>
<p>Modify the file inclusion system so that the user can override the inclusion comment markers.
For example, the user should be able to specify that <code>/*!</code> and <code>!*/</code> be used to mark inclusions.
(This is often used in tutorials that need to show the inclusion markers without them being interpreted.)</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Recursive inclusions</h3>
<p>Modify the file interpolator to support recursive includes,
i.e.,
to handle inclusion markers in files that are being included.
Be sure to check for the case of infinite includes.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Slicing files</h3>
<p>Write a function that reads a JavaScript source file
containing specially-formatted comments like the ones shown below
and extracts the indicated section.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const toBeLeftOut = (args) =&gt; {
  console.log('this should not appear')
}

// &lt;keepThis&gt;
const toBeKept = (args) =&gt; {
  console.log('only this function should appear')
}
// &lt;/keepThis&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Users should be able to specify any tag they want,
and if that tag occurs multiple times,
all of the sections marked with that tag should be kept.
(This is the approach we took for this book instead of file interpolation.)</p>
</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="module-loader">Chapter 13: Module Loader</h1>
<p><a class="crossref" href="#file-interpolator">Chapter 12</a> showed how to use <code>eval</code> to load code dynamically.
We can use this to build our own version of JavaScript's <code>require</code> function.
Our function will take the name of a source file as an argument
and return whatever that file exports.
The key requirement for such a function is to avoid accidentally overwriting things:
if we just <code>eval</code> some code and it happens to assign to a variable called <code>x</code>,
anything called <code>x</code> already in our program might be overwritten.
We therefore need a way to <span class="indexentry" index-key="encapsulation;software design!encapsulation" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#encapsulate" markdown="1">encapsulate</a></span> the contents of what we're loading.
Our approach is based on <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Casciaro2020">Casciaro2020</a></span>,
which contains a lot of other useful information as well.</p>
<h2 id="module-loader-namespace">Section 13.1:  How can we implement namespaces?</h2>
<p>A <span class="indexentry" index-key="namespace" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#namespace" markdown="1">namespace</a></span> is a collection of names in a program
that are isolated from other namespaces.
Most modern languages provide namespaces as a built-in feature
so that programmers don't accidentally step on each other's toes.
JavaScript doesn't,
so we have to implement them ourselves.</p>
<p>We can do this using <span class="indexentry" index-key="closure" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#closure" markdown="1">closures</a></span>.
Every function is a namespace:
variables defined inside the function are distinct from variables defined outside it
(<a class="figref" href="../module-loader/#module-loader-closures">Figure 13.1</a>).
If we create the variables we want to manage inside a function,
then defined another function inside the first
and return that <span class="indexentry" index-key="inner function;function!inner" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#inner_function" markdown="1">inner function</a></span>,
that inner function will be the only thing with references to those variables.</p>
<figure id="module-loader-closures">
<img alt="How closures work" src="./module-loader/figures/closures.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 13.1: Using closures to create private variables.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example,
let's create a function that always appends the same string to its argument:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const createAppender = (suffix) =&gt; {
  const appender = (text) =&gt; {
    return text + suffix
  }
  return appender
}

const exampleFunction = createAppender(' and that')
console.log(exampleFunction('this'))
console.log('suffix is', suffix)
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">When we run it,
the value that was assigned to the parameter <code>suffix</code> still exists
but can only be reached by the inner function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">this and that
/u/stjs/module-loader/manual-namespacing.js:10
console.log('suffix is', suffix)
                         ^

    at async Loader.import (internal/modules/esm/loader.js:166:24)
    at async Object.loadESM (internal/process/esm_loader.js:68:5)
</code></pre>
<p>We could require every module to define a setup function like this for users to call,
but thanks to <code>eval</code> we can wrap the file's contents in a function and call it automatically.
To do this we will create something called
an <span class="indexentry" index-key="immediately-invoked function expression" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#iife" markdown="1">immediately-invoked function expression</a></span> (IIFE).
The syntax <code>() =&gt; {...}</code> defines a function.
If we put the definition in parentheses and then put another pair of parentheses right after it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">(() =&gt; {...})()
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">we have code that defines a function of no arguments and immediately calls it.
We can use this trick to achieve the same effect as the previous example in one step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const contents = (() =&gt; {
  const privateValue = 'private value' // eslint-disable-line
  const publicValue = 'public value'
  return { publicValue }
})()

console.log(`contents.publicValue is ${contents.publicValue}`)
console.log(`contents.privateValue is ${contents.privateValue}`)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">contents.publicValue is public value
contents.privateValue is undefined
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Unconfusing the parser</h3>
<p>The extra parentheses around the original definition force the parser to evaluate things in the right order;
if we write:</p>
<p><code>js
() =&gt; {...}()</code></p>
<p class="continue">then JavaScript interprets it as a function definition followed by an empty expression
rather than an immediate call to the function just defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="module-loader-load">Section 13.2:  How can we load a module?</h2>
<p>We want the module we are loading to export names by assigning to <code>module.exports</code> just as <code>require</code> does,
so we need to provide an object called <code>module</code> and create a IIFE.
(We will handle the problem of the module loading other modules later.)
Our <code>loadModule</code> function takes a filename and returns a newly-created module object;
the parameter to the function we build and <code>eval</code> must be called <code>module</code> so that we can assign to <code>module.exports</code>.
For clarity,
we call the object we pass in <code>result</code> in <code>loadModule</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'

const loadModule = (filename) =&gt; {
  const source = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8')
  const result = {}
  const fullText = `((module) =&gt; {${source}})(result)`
  console.log(`full text for eval:\n${fullText}\n`)

<h2 id="module-loader-circular">Section 13.3:  Do we need to handle circular dependencies?</h2>
<p>What if the code we are loading loads other code?
We can visualize the network of who requires whom as a <span class="indexentry" index-key="directed graph" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#directed_graph" markdown="1">directed graph</a></span>:
if X requires Y,
we draw an arrow from X to Y.
Unlike the <span class="indexentry" index-key="directed acyclic graph" markdown="1">directed <em>acyclic</em> graphs</span> we met in <a class="crossref" href="#build-manager">Chapter 10</a>,
though,
these graphs can contain cycles:
we say a <span class="indexentry" index-key="circular dependency" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#circular_dependency" markdown="1">circular dependency</a></span> exists
if X depends on Y and Y depends on X
either directly or indirectly.
This may seem nonsensical,
but can easily arise with <span class="indexentry" index-key="plugin architecture;software design!plugin architecture" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#plugin_architecture" markdown="1">plugin architectures</a></span>:
the file containing the main program loads an extension,
and that extension calls utility functions defined in the file containing the main program.</p>
<p>Most compiled languages can handle circular dependencies easily:
they compile each module into low-level instructions,
then link those to resolve dependencies before running anything
(<a class="figref" href="../module-loader/#module-loader-circularity">Figure 13.4</a>).
But interpreted languages usually run code as they're loading it,
so if X is in the process of loading Y and Y tries to call X,
X may not (fully) exist yet.</p>

<p>We therefore won't try to handle circular dependencies.
However,
we will detect them and generate a sensible error message.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><code>import</code> vs. <code>require</code></h3>
<p>Circular dependencies work JavaScript's <code>import</code> syntax
because we can analyze files to determine what needs what,
get everything into memory,
and then resolve dependencies.
We can't do this with <code>require</code>-based code
because someone might create an <span class="indexentry" index-key="alias!during import;import!alias" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#alias" markdown="1">alias</a></span>
and call <code>require</code> through that
or <code>eval</code> a string that contains a <code>require</code> call.
(Of course, they can also do these things with the function version of <code>import</code>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="module-loader-subload">Section 13.4:  How can a module load another module?</h2>
<p>While we're not going to handle circular dependencies,
modules do need to be able to load other modules.
To enable this,
we need to provide the module with a function called <code>require</code>
that it can call as it's loading.
As in <a class="crossref" href="#file-interpolator">Chapter 12</a>,
this function checks a <span class="indexentry" index-key="cache!of loaded files" markdown="1">cache</span>
to see if the file being asked for has already been loaded.
If not, it loads it and saves it;
either way, it returns the result.</p>
<p>Our cache needs to be careful about how it identifies files
so that it can detect duplicates loading attempts that use different names.
For example,
suppose that <code>major.js</code> loads <code>subdir/first.js</code> and <code>subdir/second.js</code>.
When <code>subdir/second.js</code> loads <code>./first.js</code>,
our system needs to realize that it already has that file
even though the path looks different.
We will use <a class="glossref" href="#absolute_path" markdown="1">absolute paths</a> as cache keys
so that every file has a unique, predictable key.</p>
<p>To reduce confusion,
we will call our function <code>need</code> instead of <code>require</code>.
In order to make the cache available to modules while they're loading,
we will make it a property of <code>need</code>.
(Remember,
a function is just another kind of object in JavaScript;
every function gets several properties automatically,
and we can always add more.)
Since we're using the built-in <code>Map</code> class as a cache,
the entire implementation of <code>need</code> is just 15 lines long:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import path from 'path'

import loadModule from './load-module.js'

const need = (name) =&gt; {
  const absPath = path.resolve(name)
  if (!need.cache.has(absPath)) {
    const contents = loadModule(absPath, need)
    need.cache.set(absPath, contents)
  }
  return need.cache.get(absPath)
}
need.cache = new Map()

export default need
</code></pre>
<p>We now need to modify <code>loadModule</code> to take our function <code>need</code> as a parameter.
(Again, we'll have our modules call <code>need('something.js')</code> instead of <code>require('something')</code> for clarity.)
Let's test it with the same small module that doesn't need anything else to make sure we haven't broken anything:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import need from './need.js'

const small = need('small-module.js')
console.log(`small.publicValue is ${small.publicValue}`)
console.log(`small.privateValue is ${small.privateValue}`)
console.log(small.publicFunction('main'))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">full text for eval:
((module, need) =&gt; {
const publicValue = 'public value'

const privateValue = 'private value'

const publicFunction = (caller) =&gt; {
  return `publicFunction called from ${caller}`
}

module.exports = { publicValue, publicFunction }

})(result, need)

small.publicValue is public value
small.privateValue is undefined

<h3>"It's so deep it's meaningless"</h3>
<p>The programs we have written in this chapter are harder to understand
than most of the programs in earlier chapters
because they are so abstract.
Reading through them,
it's easy to get the feeling that everything is happening somewhere else.
Programmers' tools are often like this:
there's always a risk of confusing the thing in the program
with the thing the program is working on.
Drawing pictures of data structures can help,
and so can practicing with closures
(which are one of the most powerful ideas in programming),
but a lot of the difficulty is irreducible,
so don't feel bad if it takes you a while to wrap your head around it.</p>

<p>Programmers argue endlessly about the best way to format their programs,

<span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Binkley2012">Binkley2012</a>, <a class="bibref" href="#Johnson2019">Johnson2019</a></span>.
Since checking rules by hand is tedious,
most programmers use tools to compare code against various rules and report any violations.
Programs that do this are often called <span class="indexentry" index-key="linter;coding style!linter" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#linter" markdown="1">linters</a></span>
in honor of an early one for <span class="indexentry" index-key="C" markdown="1">C</span> named <code>lint</code>
(because it looked for fluff in source code).</p>
<p>In this chapter we will build a simple linter of our own inspired by <span class="indexentry" index-key="ESLint" markdown="1"><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a></span>,
which we use to check the code in this book.
Our tool will parse source code to create a data structure,
then go through that data structure and apply rules for each part of the program.
It will also introduce us to one of the key ideas of this book,
which is that source code is just another kind of data.</p>

<h3>Don't define your own style</h3>
<p>Just as the world doesn't need more file format (<a class="crossref" href="#regex-parser">Chapter 8</a>)

<span class="indexentry" index-key="Standard JS" markdown="1"><a href="https://standardjs.com/">Standard JS</a></span> may not do everything exactly the way you want,

<h2 id="style-checker-ast">Section 14.1:  How can we parse JavaScript to create an AST?</h2>
<p>A parser for a simple language like arithmetic or JSON is relatively easy to write.
A parser for a language as complex as JavaScript is much more work,
so we will use one called <span class="indexentry" index-key="Acorn" markdown="1"><a href="https://github.com/acornjs/acorn">Acorn</a></span> instead.
Acorn takes a string containing source code as input
and produces an <span class="indexentry" index-key="abstract syntax tree" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#abstract_syntax_tree" markdown="1">abstract syntax tree</a></span> (AST)
whose nodes store information about what's in the program
(<a class="figref" href="../style-checker/#style-checker-parse-tree">Figure 14.1</a>).
An AST is for a program what the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Document Object Model" markdown="1">DOM</span> is for HTML:
an in-memory representation that is easy for software to inspect and manipulate.</p>

<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 14.1: The parse tree of a simple program.</figcaption>

<p>ASTs can be quite complex---for example,
the JSON representation of the AST for a single constant declaration
is 84 lines long:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import acorn from 'acorn'

<h2 id="style-checker-search">Section 14.2:  How can we find things in an AST?</h2>
<p>If we want to find functions, variables, or anything else in an AST
we need to <span class="indexentry" index-key="walk a tree" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#walk_tree" markdown="1">walk the tree</a></span>,
i.e.,
to visit each node in turn.
The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/acorn-walk"><code>acorn-walk</code></a> library will do this for us
using the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Visitor pattern;design pattern!Visitor" markdown="1">Visitor design pattern</span> we first saw in <a class="crossref" href="#page-templates">Chapter 9</a>
If we provide a function to act on nodes of type <code>Identifier</code>,
<code>acorn-walk</code> will call that function each time it finds an identifier.
We can use other options to say that we want to record the locations of nodes (i.e., their line numbers)
and to collect comments in an array called <code>onComment</code>.
Our function can do whatever we want;
for demonstration purposes we will add nodes to an array called <code>state</code>
and report them all at the end

<h3>There's more than one way to do it</h3>
<p><code>walk.simple</code> takes four arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The root node of the AST, which is used as the starting point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An object containing callback functions for handling various kinds of nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another object that specifies what algorithm to use---we have set this to <code>null</code>
    to use the default because
    we don't particularly care about the order in which the nodes are processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something we want passed in to each of the node handlers,
    which in our case is the <code>state</code> array.
    If our node handling functions don't require any extra data
    from one call to the next
    we can leave this out;
    if we want to accumulate information across calls,
    this argument acts as the Visitor's memory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any general-purpose implementation of the Visitor pattern
is going to need these four things,
but as we will see below,
we can implement them in different ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="style-checker-apply">Section 14.3:  How can we apply checks?</h2>
<p>We don't just want to collect nodes:
we want to check their properties against a set of rules.
One way to do this would be to call <code>walk.simple</code> once for each rule,
passing it a function that checks just that rule.
Another way---the one we'll use---is to write a <span class="indexentry" index-key="software design!generic function" markdown="1">generic function</span>
that checks a rule and records any nodes that don't satisfy it,
and then call that function once for each rule inside our <code>Identifier</code> handler.
This may see like extra work,
but it ensures that all of our rule-checkers store their results in the same way,
which in turn means that we can write one reporting function
and be sure it will handle everything.</p>
<p>The function  <code>applyCheck</code> takes the current state (where we are accumulating rule violations),
a label that identifies this rule (so that violations of it can be stored together),
the node,
and a logical value telling it whether the node passed the test or not.
If the node failed the test
we make sure that <code>state</code> contains a list with the appropriate label
and then append this node to it.
This "create storage space on demand" pattern
is widely used but doesn't have a well-known name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const applyCheck = (state, label, node, passes) =&gt; {
  if (!passes) {
    if (!(label in state)) {
      state[label] = []
    }
    state[label].push(node)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can now put a call to <code>applyCheck</code> inside the handler for <code>Identifier</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const ast = acorn.parse(program, { locations: true })

const state = {}
walk.simple(ast, {
  Identifier: (node, state) =&gt; {
    applyCheck(state, 'name_length', node, node.name.length &gt;= 4)
  }
}, null, state)

state.name_length.forEach(
  node =&gt; console.log(`${node.name} at line ${node.loc.start.line}`))
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">We can't just use <code>applyCheck</code> as the handler for <code>Identifier</code>
because <code>walk.simple</code> wouldn't know how to call it.
This is a (very simple) example of the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Adapter pattern;design pattern!Adapter" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#adapter_pattern" markdown="1">Adapter</a></span> design pattern:
we write a function or class to connect the code we want to call
to the already-written code that is going to call it.</p>
<p>The output for the same sample program as before is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">x at line 6
y at line 7
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The exercises will ask why the parameter <code>x</code> doesn't show up
as a violation of our rule
that variables' names must be at least four characters long.</p>
<h2 id="style-checker-walker">Section 14.4:  How does the AST walker work?</h2>
<p>The AST walker uses the Visitor pattern,
but how does it actually work?
We can build our own by defining a class with methods that walk the tree,
take action depending on the kind of node,
and then go through the children of that node (if any).
The user can then derive a class of their own from this
and override the set of action methods they're interested in.</p>
<p>One key difference between our implementation and <code>acorn-walk</code>'s is that
our methods don't need to take <code>state</code> as a parameter
because it's contained in the object that they're part of.
That simplifies the methods---one less parameter---but it does mean that
anyone who wants to use our visitor has to derive a class,
which is a bit more complicated than writing a function.
This tradeoff is a sign that managing state is part of the problem's
<span class="indexentry" index-key="intrinsic complexity" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#intrinsic_complexity" markdown="1">intrinsic complexity</a></span>:
we can move it around,
but we can't get rid of it.</p>
<p>The other difference between our visitor and <code>acorn-walk</code> is that
our class uses <span class="indexentry" index-key="dynamic lookup" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#dynamic_lookup" markdown="1">dynamic lookup</a></span>
(a form of <span class="indexentry" index-key="introspection!of methods" markdown="1">introspection</span>)
to look up a method
with the same name as the node type in the object.
While we normally refer to a particular method of an object using <code>object.method</code>,
we can also look them up by asking for <code>object[name]</code>
in the same way that we would look up any other property of any other object.
Our completed class looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Walker {
  // Construct a new AST tree walker.
  constructor (ast) {
    this.ast = ast
  }

  // Walk the tree.
  walk (accumulator) {
    this.stack = []
    this._walk(this.ast, accumulator)
    return accumulator
  }

  // Act on node and then on children.
  _walk (node, accumulator) {
    if (node &amp;&amp; (typeof node === 'object') &amp;&amp; ('type' in node)) {
      this._doNode(node, accumulator)
      this._doChildren(node, accumulator)
    }
  }

  // Handle a single node by lookup.
  _doNode (node, accumulator) {
    if (node.type in this) {
      this[node.type](node, accumulator)
    }
  }

  // Recurse for anything interesting within the node.
  _doChildren (node, accumulator) {
    this.stack.push(node)
    for (const key in node) {
      if (Array.isArray(node[key])) {
        node[key].forEach(child =&gt; {
          this._walk(child, accumulator)
        })
      } else if (typeof node[key] === 'object') {
        this._walk(node[key], accumulator)
      }
    }
    this.stack.pop(node)
  }

  // Is the current node a child of some other type of node?
  _childOf (nodeTypes) {
    return this.stack &amp;&amp;
      nodeTypes.includes(this.stack.slice(-1)[0].type)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code we need to use it is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import acorn from 'acorn'


// Walk to accumulate variable and parameter definitions.
class VariableWalker extends Walker {
  Identifier (node, accumulator) {
    if (this._childOf(['ArrowFunctionExpression',
      'VariableDeclarator'])) {
      accumulator.push(node.name)
    }
  }
}

// Test.
const program = `const value = 2

const double = (x) =&gt; {
  const y = 2 * x
  return y

`

const ast = acorn.parse(program, { locations: true })
const walker = new VariableWalker(ast)
const accumulator = []
walker.walk(accumulator)

<p>We think this approach to implementing the Visitor pattern is easier to understand and extend
than one that relies on callbacks,
but that could just be a reflection of our background and experience.
As with code style,
the most important thing is consistency:
if we implement Visitor using classes in one place,
we should implement it that way everywhere.</p>
<h2 id="style-checker-alternatives">Section 14.5:  How else could the AST walker work?</h2>
<p>A third approach to this problem uses
the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Iterator pattern;design pattern!Iterator" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#iterator_pattern" markdown="1">Iterator</a></span> design pattern.
Instead of taking the computation to the nodes as a visitor does,
an iterator returns the elements of a complex structure one by one for processing
(<a class="figref" href="../style-checker/#style-checker-iterator">Figure 14.3</a>).
One way to think about it is that the Visitor pattern encapsulates recursion,
while the Iterator pattern turns everything into a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<figure id="style-checker-iterator">
<img alt="The Iterator pattern" src="./style-checker/figures/iterator.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 14.3: Finding nodes in the tree using the Iterator pattern.</figcaption>

<p>We can implement the Iterator pattern in JavaScript using
<span class="indexentry" index-key="generator function;Iterator pattern!generator function" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#generator_function" markdown="1">generator functions</a></span>.
If we declare a function using <code>function *</code> (with an asterisk) instead of <code>function</code>
then we can use the <code>yield</code> keyword to return a value and suspend processing to be resumed later.
The result of <code>yield</code> is a two-part structure with a value and a flag showing whether or not processing is done:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function * threeWords () {
  yield 'first'
  yield 'second'
  yield 'third'

const gen = threeWords()

console.log(gen.next())
console.log(gen.next())

<pre><code class="language-out">{ value: 'first', done: false }
{ value: 'second', done: false }
{ value: 'third', done: false }
{ value: undefined, done: true }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">A generator function doesn't actually generate anything;
instead,
it creates an object that we can then ask for values repeatedly.
This gives us a way to have several generators in play at the same time.</p>
<p>As another example,
this generator takes a string and produces its vowels one by one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function * getVowels (text) {
  for (const char of text) {
    if ('AEIOUaeiou'.includes(char)) {
      yield char
    }
  }
}

const test = 'this is a test'
const gen = getVowels(test)
let current = gen.next()
while (!current.done) {
  console.log(current.value)
  current = gen.next()
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">i
i
a
e
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of a <code>while</code> loop it is much more common to use <code>for...of</code>,
which knows how to work with generators:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">for (const vowel of getVowels(test)) {
  console.log(vowel)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally,
just as <code>function *</code> says "this function is a generator",
<code>yield *</code> says "yield the values from a nested generator one by one".
We can use it to walk irregular structures like nested arrays:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function * getNodes (here) {
  if (typeof here === 'string') {
    yield here
  } else if (Array.isArray(here)) {
    for (const child of here) {
      yield * getNodes(child)
    }
  } else {
    throw new Error(`unknown type "${typeof here}"`)
  }
}

const nested = ['first', ['second', 'third']]
for (const value of getNodes(nested)) {
  console.log(value)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's use generators to count the number of expressions of various types in a program.
The generator function that visits each node is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function * getNodes (node) {
  if (node &amp;&amp; (typeof node === 'object') &amp;&amp; ('type' in node)) {
    yield node
    for (const key in node) {
      if (Array.isArray(node[key])) {
        for (const child of node[key]) {
          yield * getNodes(child)
        }
      } else if (typeof node[key] === 'object') {
        yield * getNodes(node[key])
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and the program that uses it is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const ast = acorn.parse(program, { locations: true })
const result = {}
for (const node of getNodes(ast)) {
  if (node.type === 'BinaryExpression') {
    if (node.operator in result) {
      result[node.operator] += 1
    } else {
      result[node.operator] = 1
    }
  }
}
console.log('counts are', result)
</code></pre>
<p>When we run it with our usual test program as input, we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">counts are { '*': 2, '+': 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>Generators are a clean solution to many hard problems,
but we find it more difficult to check variable identifiers using generators
than using the class-based Visitor approach
because we want to accumulate violations to report later.
Again,
this could be a reflection of what we're used to rather than anything intrinsic;
as with coding style,
the most important thing is to be consistent.</p>
<h2 id="style-checker-analysis">Section 14.6:  What other kinds of analysis can we do?</h2>
<p>As one final example,
consider the problem of keeping track of which methods are defined where
in a deeply-nested class hierarchy.
(This problem comes up in some of the later chapters in this book:
we wrote so many classes that incrementally extended their predecessors for pedagogical purposes
that we lost track of what was defined where.)
To create a table of method definitions,
we first need to find the ancestors of the last class in the hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'
import acorn from 'acorn'
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import walk from 'acorn-walk'

class FindAncestors {
  find (dirname, filename, className) {
    return this.traceAncestry(dirname, filename, className, [])
  }

  traceAncestry (dirname, filename, className, accum) {
    const fullPath = path.join(dirname, filename)
    const program = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf-8')
    const options = { locations: true, sourceType: 'module' }
    const ast = acorn.parse(program, options)
    const classDef = this.findClassDef(filename, ast, className)
    accum.push({ filename, className, classDef })
    const ancestorName = this.getAncestor(classDef)
    if (ancestorName === null) {
      return accum
    }
    const ancestorFile = this.findImport(filename, ast, ancestorName)
    return this.traceAncestry(dirname, ancestorFile, ancestorName, accum)
  }

}

export default FindAncestors
</code></pre>
<p>Finding class definitions is a straightforward extension of what we have already done:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  findClassDef (filename, ast, className) {
    const state = []
    walk.simple(ast, {
      ClassDeclaration: (node, state) =&gt; {
        if ((node.id.type === 'Identifier') &amp;&amp;
            (node.id.name === className)) {
          state.push(node)
        }
      }
    }, null, state)
    assert(state.length === 1,
      `No definition for ${className} in ${filename}`)
    return state[0]
  }
</code></pre>
<p>To test this code, we start with the last of these three short files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Upper {
  constructor () {
    this.name = 'upper'
  }

  report () {
    console.log(this.modify(this.name))
  }

  modify (text) {
    return text.toUpperCase()
  }
}

module.exports = Upper
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Upper from './upper.js'

class Middle extends Upper {
  constructor () {
    super()
    this.range = 'middle'
  }

  modify (text) {
    return `** ${super.modify(text)} **`
  }
}

export default Middle
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Middle from './middle.js'

class Lower extends Middle {
  report () {
    console.log(this.additional())
  }

  additional () {
    return 'lower'
  }
}

export default Lower
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">Lower in lower.js
Middle in ./middle.js
Upper in ./upper.js
</code></pre>
<p>Good: we can recover the <span class="indexentry" index-key="chain of inheritance" markdown="1">chain of inheritance</span>.
Finding method definitions is also straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import FindAncestors from './find-ancestors.js'

class FindMethods extends FindAncestors {
  find (dirname, filename, className) {
    const classes = super.find(dirname, filename, className)
    classes.forEach(record =&gt; {
      record.methods = this.findMethods(record.classDef)
    })
    return classes
  }

  findMethods (classDef) {
    return classDef.body.body
      .filter(item =&gt; item.type === 'MethodDefinition')
      .map(item =&gt; {
        if (item.kind === 'constructor') {
          return 'constructor'
        } else if (item.kind === 'method') {
          return item.key.name
        } else {
          return null
        }
      })
      .filter(item =&gt; item !== null)
  }
}

export default FindMethods
</code></pre>
<p>And finally,
we can print a <span class="indexentry" index-key="Markdown" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#markdown" markdown="1">Markdown</a></span>-formatted table
showing which methods are defined in which class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">| method | Upper | Middle | Lower |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| additional | . | . | X |
| constructor | X | X | . |
| modify | X | X | . |
| report | X | . | X |
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">which renders as:</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>This may seem rather pointless for our toy example,
but it proves its worth when we are looking at something like
the virtual machine we will build in <a class="crossref" href="#virtual-machine">Chapter 19</a>,
which has a more complex method definition table:</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Function length</h3>
<p>Derive a class from <code>Walker</code> that reports the length in lines of each function defined in the code being checked.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Expression depth</h3>
<p>Derive a class from <code>Walker</code> that reports how deep each top-level expression in the source code is.
For example,
the depth of <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> is 2,
while the depth of <code>max(1 + 2 + 3)</code> is 3
(one level for the function call, one for the first addition, and one for the nested addition).</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Downward and upward</h3>
<p>Modify <code>Walker</code> so that users can specify
one action to take at a node on the way down the tree
and a separate action to take on the way up.
(Hint: require users to specify <code>Nodename_downward</code> and/or <code>Nodename_upward</code> methods in their class,
then use string concatenation to construct method names while traversing the tree.)</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Aggregating across files</h3>
<p>Create a command-line program called <code>sniff.js</code>
that checks for style violations in any number of source files.
The first command-line argument to <code>sniff.js</code> must be a JavaScript source file
that exports a class derived from <code>Walker</code> called <code>Check</code>
that implements the checks the user wants.
The other command-line arguments must be the names of JavaScript source files to be checked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node sniff.js my-check.js source-1.js source-2.js
</code></pre>
<h3 class="exercise">Finding assertions</h3>
<p>Write a program <code>find-assertions.js</code> that finds all calls to <code>assert</code> or <code>assert.something</code>
and prints the assertion message (if any).</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Finding a missing parameter</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why doesn't the parameter <code>x</code> show up as a rule violation
    in the example where we check name lengths?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the example so that it does.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Finding nested indexes</h3>
<p>Write a tool that finds places where nested indexing is used,
i.e.,
where the program contains expression like <code>arr[table[i]]</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Dynamic lookup</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a function <code>dynamicExecution</code> that takes an object,
    the name of a method,
    and zero or more parameters as arguments
    and calls that method on that object:</p>
<p><code>js
dynamicExecution(obj, 'meth', 1, 'a')
// same as obj.meth(1, 'a')</code></p>

</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="code-generator">Chapter 15: Code Generator</h1>
<p>We've been writing tests since <a class="crossref" href="#unit-test">Chapter 4</a>,
but how much of our code do they actually check?
One way to find out is to use a <span class="indexentry" index-key="code coverage" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#code_coverage" markdown="1">code coverage</a></span> tool
like <span class="indexentry" index-key="Istanbul" markdown="1"><a href="https://istanbul.js.org/">Istanbul</a></span>
that watches a program while it executes
and keeps track of which lines have run and which haven't.
Making sure that each line is tested at least once doesn't guarantee that the code is bug-free,
but any code that <em>isn't</em> run shouldn't be trusted.</p>
<p>Our code coverage tool will keep track of which functions have and haven't been called.
Rather than rewriting <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> to keep track of this for us,
we will modify the functions themselves
by parsing the code with <span class="indexentry" index-key="Acorn" markdown="1"><a href="https://github.com/acornjs/acorn">Acorn</a></span>,
inserting the instructions we need into the <span class="indexentry" index-key="abstract syntax tree" markdown="1">AST</span>,
and then turning the AST back into code.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Simple usually isn't</h3>
<p>At first glance it would be a lot simpler
to use regular expressions to find every line that looks like the start of a function definition
and insert a line right after each one
to record the information we want.
Of course,
some people split function headers across several lines if they have lots of parameters,
and there might be things that look like function definitions embedded in comments or strings.
It doesn't take long before our simple solution turns into
a poorly-implemented parser for a subset of JavaScript that no-one else understands.
Using a full-blown parser and working with the AST is almost always less work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="code-generator-replace">Section 15.1:  How can we replace a function with another function?</h2>
<p>The first thing we need is a way to wrap up an arbitrary function call.
If we declare a function in JavaScript with a parameter like <code>...args</code>,
all of the "extra" arguments in the call that don't line up with regular parameters
are stuffed into the variable <code>args</code>
(<a class="figref" href="../code-generator/#code-generator-spread">Figure 15.1</a>).
We can also call a function by putting values in a variable
and using <code>func(...var)</code> to <span class="indexentry" index-key="spread!function arguments" markdown="1">spread</span> those values out.
There's nothing special about the names <code>args</code> and <code>vars</code>:
what matters is the ellipsis <code>...</code></p>
<figure id="code-generator-spread">
<img alt="Spreading parameters" src="./code-generator/figures/spread.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 15.1: Using ...args to capture and spread parameters.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can use <code>...args</code> to capture all of the arguments to a function call
and forward them to another function.
Let's start by creating functions with a varying number of parameters
that run to completion or throw an exception,
then run them to make sure they do what we want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let zero = () =&gt; console.log('zero')

let one = (first) =&gt; console.log(`one(${first})`)

let two = (first, second) =&gt; console.log(`two(${first}, ${second})`)

let error = () =&gt; {
  console.log('error')
  throw new Error('from error')
  console.log('should not reach this') // eslint-disable-line
}

const runAll = (title) =&gt; {
  console.log(title)
  zero()
  one(1)
  two(1, 2)
  try {
    error()
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`caught ${error} as expected`)
  }
  console.log()
}

runAll('first time')
</code></pre>
<p>We can now write a function that takes a function as an input
and creates a new function that handles all of the errors in the original function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const replace = (func) =&gt; {
  return (...args) =&gt; {
    console.log('before')
    try {
      const result = func(...args)
      console.log('after')
      return result
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('error')
      throw error
    }
  }
}

zero = replace(zero)
one = replace(one)
two = replace(two)
error = replace(error)

runAll('second time')
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try it out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">first time
zero
one(1)
two(1, 2)
error
caught Error: from error as expected

second time
before
zero
after
before
one(1)
after
before
two(1, 2)
after
before
error
error
caught Error: from error as expected
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Decorator pattern;design pattern!Decorator" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#decorator_pattern" markdown="1">Decorator</a></span> design pattern.
A decorator is a function whose job is to modify the behavior of other functions
in some general ways.
Decorators are built in to some languages (like <span class="indexentry" index-key="Python" markdown="1"><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></span>),
and we can add them in most others as we have done here.</p>
<h2 id="code-generator-generate">Section 15.2:  How can we generate JavaScript?</h2>
<p>We could use a decorator to replace every function in our program
with one that keeps track of whether or not it was called,
but it would be tedious to apply the decorator to every one of our functions by hand.
What we really want is a way to do this automatically for everything,
and for that we need to parse and generate code.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Other ways to do it</h3>
<p>A third way to achieve what we want is
to let the system turn code into runnable instructions
and then modify those instructions.
This approach is often used in compiled languages like <span class="indexentry" index-key="Java" markdown="1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a></span>,
where the <a class="glossref" href="#byte_code" markdown="1">byte code</a> produced by the <a class="glossref" href="#compiler" markdown="1">compiler</a> is saved in files
in order to be run.
We can't do this here because Node compiles and runs code in a single step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our tool will parse the JavaScript with Acorn to create an AST,
modify the AST,
and then use a library called <span class="indexentry" index-key="Escodegen" markdown="1"><a href="https://github.com/estools/escodegen/">Escodegen</a></span> to turn the AST back into JavaScript.
To start,
let's look at the AST for a simple function definition,
which is 75 lines of pretty-printed JSON:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import acorn from 'acorn'

const text = `const func = (param) =&gt; {
  return param + 1
}`

const ast = acorn.parse(text, { sourceType: 'module' })
console.log(JSON.stringify(ast, null, 2))

<h2 id="code-generator-count">Section 15.3:  How can we count how often functions are executed?</h2>
<p>Our tool will find all the function declaration nodes in the program
and insert a node to increment an entry in a global variable called <code>__counters</code>.
(Prefixing the name with two underscores doesn't guarantee that
we won't accidentally clobber a variable in the user's program with the same name,
but hopefully it makes that less likely.)
Our test case is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const TEXT = `
const funcOuter = (param) =&gt; {
  return param + 1
}
const funcInner = (param) =&gt; {
  return param + 1
}
for (const i of [1, 3, 5]) {
  funcOuter(funcInner(i) + funcInner(i))
}
`
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and the main function of our program is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = () =&gt; {
  const ast = acorn.parse(TEXT, { sourceType: 'module' })

  const allNodes = []
  walk.simple(ast, {
    VariableDeclarator: (node, state) =&gt; {
      if (node.init &amp;&amp; (node.init.type === 'ArrowFunctionExpression')) {

  console.log(initializeCounters(names))
  console.log(escodegen.generate(ast))
  console.log(reportCounters())

<p>To insert a count we call <code>insertCounter</code>
to record the function's name and modify the node:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const insertCounter = (names, node) =&gt; {
  const name = node.id.name
  names[name] = 0

  const body = node.init.body.body
  const increment =
    acorn.parse(`__counters['${name}'] += 1`, { sourceType: 'module' })
  body.unshift(increment)

<p class="continue">Notice how we don't try to build the nodes by hand,
but instead construct the string we need,
use <span class="indexentry" index-key="Acorn" markdown="1">Acorn</span> to parse that,
and use the result.
Doing this saves us from embedding multiple lines of JSON in our program
and also ensures that if a newer version of Acorn decides to generate a different AST,
our program will do the right thing automatically.</p>
<p>Finally,
we need to add a couple of <span class="indexentry" index-key="helper function" markdown="1">helper functions</span>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const initializeCounters = (names) =&gt; {
  const body = Object.keys(names).map(n =&gt; `'${n}': 0`).join(',\n')
  return 'const __counters = {\n' + body + '\n}'

<h3>Too simple to be safe</h3>
<p>Our simple approach to naming counters doesn't work if functions can have the same names,
which they can if we use modules or <span class="indexentry" index-key="nested function;function!nested" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#nested_function" markdown="1">nested functions</a></span>.
One way to solve this would be to manufacture a label from the function's name
and the line number in the source code;
another would be to keep track of which functions are nested within which
and concatenate their names to produce a unique key.
Problems like this are why people say that naming things
is one of the <span class="indexentry" index-key="two hard problems in computer science" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#two_hard_problems" markdown="1">two hard problems</a></span> in computer science.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="code-generator-time">Section 15.4:  How can we time function execution?</h2>
<p>Now that we have a way to insert code into functions
we can use it to do many other things.
For example,
we can find out how long it takes functions to run
by wrapping them up in code that records the start and end time of each call.
As before,
we find the nodes of interest and decorate them,
then stitch the result together with a bit of bookkeeping:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const timeFunc = (text) =&gt; {
  const ast = acorn.parse(text, { sourceType: 'module' })
  const allNodes = gatherNodes(ast)
  allNodes.forEach(node =&gt; wrapFuncDef(node))
  return [
    initializeCounters(allNodes),
    escodegen.generate(ast),
    reportCounters()
  ].join('\n')
}
</code></pre>
<p>Gathering nodes is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const gatherNodes = (ast) =&gt; {
  const allNodes = []
  walk.simple(ast, {
    VariableDeclarator: (node, state) =&gt; {
      if (node.init &amp;&amp; (node.init.type === 'ArrowFunctionExpression')) {
        state.push(node)
      }
    }
  }, null, allNodes)
  return allNodes
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">as is wrapping the function definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const wrapFuncDef = (originalAst) =&gt; {
  const name = originalAst.id.name
  const wrapperAst = makeWrapperAst(name)
  wrapperAst.init.body.body[0].declarations[0].init = originalAst.init
  originalAst.init = wrapperAst.init
}
</code></pre>
<p>The only big difference is how we make the wrapper function.
We create it with a placeholder for the original function
so that we have a spot in the AST to insert the actual code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const timeFunc = (text) =&gt; {
  const ast = acorn.parse(text, { sourceType: 'module' })
  const allNodes = gatherNodes(ast)
  allNodes.forEach(node =&gt; wrapFuncDef(node))
  return [
    initializeCounters(allNodes),
    escodegen.generate(ast),
    reportCounters()
  ].join('\n')
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's run one last test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">const __counters = {
'assignment': 0,
'readFile': 0
}
const assignment = (...originalArgs) =&gt; {
    const originalFunc = range =&gt; {
        let j = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i &lt; range; i += 1) {
            j = i;
        }
    };
    const startTime = Date.now();
    try {
        const result = originalFunc(...originalArgs);
        const endTime = Date.now();
        __counters['assignment'] += endTime - startTime;
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        const endTime = Date.now();
        __counters['assignment'] += endTime - startTime;
        throw error;
    }
};
const readFile = (...originalArgs) =&gt; {
    const originalFunc = (range, filename) =&gt; {
        for (let i = 0; i &lt; range; i += 1) {
            fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8');
        }
    };
    const startTime = Date.now();
    try {
        const result = originalFunc(...originalArgs);
        const endTime = Date.now();
        __counters['readFile'] += endTime - startTime;
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        const endTime = Date.now();
        __counters['readFile'] += endTime - startTime;
        throw error;
    }
};
const numLoops = 100000;
assignment(numLoops);
readFile(numLoops, 'index.md');
console.log(__counters)
OUTPUT
{ assignment: 1, readFile: 3879 }

<p>Source-to-source translation is widely used in JavaScript:
tools like <span class="indexentry" index-key="Babel" markdown="1"><a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a></span> use it to transform modern features like <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>
(<a class="crossref" href="#async-programming">Chapter 3</a>)
into code that older browsers can understand.
The technique is so powerful that it is built into languages like Scheme,
which allow programmers to add new syntax to the language
by defining <span class="indexentry" index-key="macro" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#macro" markdown="1">macros</a></span>.
Depending on how carefully they are used,
macros can make programs elegant, incomprehensible, or both.</p>
<div class="break-before"></div>
<h2 id="code-generator-exercises">Section 15.5:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">JSON to JavaScript</h3>
<p>Write a tool that uses <a href="https://github.com/estools/escodegen/">Escodegen</a>
to translate simple expressions written in JSON into runnable JavaScript.
For example, the tool should translate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">['+', 3, ['*', 5, 'a']]
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">into:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">3 + (5 * a)
</code></pre>
<h3 class="exercise">JavaScript to HTML</h3>
<p>Write a function that takes nested JavaScript function calls for generating HTML like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">div(h1('title'), p('explanation'))
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and turns them into HTML like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;explanation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 class="exercise">Handling modules</h3>
<p>Modify the code that counts the number of times a function is called
to handle functions with the same name from different modules.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Tracking calls</h3>
<p>Write a decorator that takes a function as its argument
and returns a new function that behaves exactly the same way
except that it keeps track of who called it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The program contains a stack where decorated functions push and pop their names
    as they are called and as they exit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each time a function is called
    it adds a record to an array to record its name and the name at the top of the stack
    (i.e., the most-recently-called decorated function).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Counting classical function definitions</h3>
<p>Modify the code generator to handle functions declared with the <code>function</code> keyword
as well as functions declared using <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Recording input file size</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a program that replaces all calls to <code>fs.readFileSync</code>
    with calls to <code>readFileSyncCount</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the function <code>readFileSyncCount</code> to read and return a file using <code>fs.readFileSync</code>
    but to also record the file's name and size in bytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a third function <code>reportInputFileSizes</code> that reports
    what files were read and how large they were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write tests for these functions using Mocha and <code>mock-fs</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Checking argument types</h3>
<p>Write a tool that modifies functions to check the types of their arguments at run-time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each function is replaced by a function that passes all of its arguments to <code>checkArgs</code>
    along with the function's name,
    then continues with the function's original operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first time <code>checkArgs</code> is called for a particular function
    it records the actual types of the arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On subsequent calls, it checks that the argument types match those of the first call
    and throws an exception if they do not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Two-dimensional arrays</h3>
<p>The function <code>make2D</code> takes a row length and one or more values
and creates a two-dimensional array from those values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">make2D(2, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
// produces [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Write a function that searches code to find calls to <code>make2D</code>
and replaces them with inline arrays-of-arrays.
This function only has to work for calls with a fixed row length,
i.e., it does <em>not</em> have to handle <code>make2D(N, 'a', 'b')</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">From require to import</h3>
<p>Write a function that searches code for simple calls to <code>require</code>
and replaces them with calls to <code>import</code>.
This function only needs to work for the simplest case;
for example, if the input is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const name = require('module')
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">then the output is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import name from 'module'
</code></pre>
<h3 class="exercise">Removing empty constructors</h3>
<p>Write a function that removes empty constructors from class definitions.
For example, if the input is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Example {
  constructor () {
  }

  someMethod () {
    console.log('some method')
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">then the output should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Example {
  someMethod () {
    console.log('some method')
  }
}
</code></pre>
</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="doc-generator">Chapter 16: Documentation Generator</h1>
<p>Many programmers believe they're more likely to write documentation and keep it up to date
if it is close to the code.
Tools that extract specially-formatted comments from code and turn them into documentation
have been around since at least the 1980s;
many are used for JavaScript,
including <span class="indexentry" index-key="JSDoc" markdown="1"><a href="https://jsdoc.app/">JSDoc</a></span> and <span class="indexentry" index-key="ESDoc" markdown="1"><a href="https://esdoc.org/">ESDoc</a></span>.
This chapter will use what we learned in <a class="crossref" href="#code-generator">Chapter 15</a> about parsing source code
to build a simple documentation generator of our own.</p>
<h2 id="doc-generator-extract">Section 16.1:  How can we extract documentation comments?</h2>
<p>We will use <span class="indexentry" index-key="Acorn" markdown="1"><a href="https://github.com/acornjs/acorn">Acorn</a></span> once again to parse our source files.
This time we will use the parser's <code>onComment</code> option,
giving it an array to fill in.
For the moment we won't bother to assign the <span class="indexentry" index-key="abstract syntax tree" markdown="1">AST</span> produced by parsing to a variable
because we are just interested in the comments:</p>

<p>The doc comments are unpleasant at the moment:
they repeat the function and method names from the code,
we have to create titles ourselves,
and we have to remember the back-quotes for formatting code.
We will fix some of these problems once we have a basic tool up and running.</p>
<p>The next step in doing that is to translate Markdown into HTML.
There are many <span class="indexentry" index-key="Markdown!parser" markdown="1">Markdown parsers</span> in JavaScript;
after experimenting with a few,
we decided to use <a href="https://markdown-it.github.io/"><code>markdown-it</code></a>
along with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-anchor"><code>markdown-it-anchor</code></a> extension
that creates HTML anchors for headings.
The main program gets all the doc comments from all of the input files,
converts the Markdown to HTML,
and displays that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const HEAD = '&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style="font-size: 100%; margin-left: 0.5em"&gt;'
const FOOT = '&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;'

const main = () =&gt; {
  const allComments = getAllComments(process.argv.slice(2))
  const md = new MarkdownIt({ html: true })
    .use(MarkdownAnchor, { level: 1, slugify: slugify })
  const html = md.render(allComments)
  console.log(HEAD)
  console.log(html)
  console.log(FOOT)
}
</code></pre>
<p>To get all the comments
we extract comments from all the files,
remove the leading <code>*</code> characters (which aren't part of the documentation),
and then join the results after stripping off extraneous blanks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const getAllComments = (allFilenames) =&gt; {
  return allFilenames
    .map(filename =&gt; {
      const comments = extractComments(filename)
      return { filename, comments }
    })
    .map(({ filename, comments }) =&gt; {
      comments = comments.map(comment =&gt; removePrefix(comment))
      return { filename, comments }
    })
    .map(({ filename, comments }) =&gt; {
      const combined = comments
        .map(comment =&gt; comment.stripped)
        .join('\n\n')
      return `# ${filename}\n\n${combined}`
    })
    .join('\n\n')
}
</code></pre>
<p>Extracting the comments from a single file is done as before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const extractComments = (filename) =&gt; {
  const text = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8')
  const options = {
    sourceType: 'module',
    locations: true,
    onComment: []
  }
  acorn.parse(text, options)
  const subset = options.onComment
    .filter(entry =&gt; entry.type === 'Block')
    .map(entry =&gt; {
      return {
        type: entry.type,
        value: entry.value,
        start: entry.start,
        end: entry.end
      }
    })
  return subset
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and removing the prefix <code>*</code> characters is a matter of splitting the text into lines,

and putting the lines back together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const removePrefix = (comment) =&gt; {

    .split('\n')
    .slice(0, -1)

<p>One thing that isn't in this file (because we're going to use it in later versions)
is the function <code>slugify</code>.
A <span class="indexentry" index-key="slug (unique identifier)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#slug" markdown="1">slug</a></span> is a short string that identifies a header or a web page;
the name comes from the era of newspapers,
where a slug was a short name used to identify an article while it was in production.
Our <code>slugify</code> function strips unnecessary characters out of a title,
adds hyphens,
and generally makes it something you might see in a URL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const slugify = (text) =&gt; {
  return encodeURIComponent(
    text.split(' ')[0]
      .replace(/.js$/, '')
      .trim()
      .toLowerCase()
      .replace(/[^ \w]/g, '')
      .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
  )
}

export default slugify

<p>It works,
but there is a double <code>h1</code> header for each file (the filename and and the title comment),
the anchor IDs are hard to read,
there are no cross-references,
and so on.
Some of the visual issues can be resolved with <span class="indexentry" index-key="CSS" markdown="1">CSS</span>,
and we can change our input format to make processing easier
as long as it also makes authoring easier.
However,
anything that is written twice will eventually be wrong in one place or another,
so our first priority is to remove duplication.</p>
<h2 id="doc-generator-dup">Section 16.3:  How can we avoid duplicating names?</h2>
<p>If a comment is the first thing in a file,
we want to use it as title text;
this will save us having to write an explicit level-1 title in a comment.
For each other comment,
we can extract the name of the function or method
from the node on the line immediately following the doc comment.
This allows us to write much tidier comments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/**
 * Overall file header.
 */

/**
 * Double the input.
 */
const double = (x) =&gt; 2 * x // eslint-disable-line

/**
 * Triple the input.
 */
function triple (x) { // eslint-disable-line
  return 3 * x
}

/**
 * Define a class.
 */
class Example { // eslint-disable-line
  /**
   * Method description.
   */
  someMethod () {
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To extract and display information from nodes immediately following doc comments
we must find all the block comments,
record the last line of each,
and then search the AST to find nodes that are on lines
immediately following any of those trailing comment lines.
(We will assume for now that there are no blank lines between the comment
and the start of the class or function.)
The main program finds the comments as usual,
creates a set containing the line numbers we are looking for,
then searches for the nodes we want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = () =&gt; {
  const options = {
    sourceType: 'module',
    locations: true,
    onComment: []
  }
  const text = fs.readFileSync(process.argv[2], 'utf-8')
  const ast = acorn.parse(text, options)
  const comments = options.onComment
    .filter(entry =&gt; entry.type === 'Block')
    .map(entry =&gt; {
      return {
        value: entry.value,
        start: entry.loc.start.line,
        end: entry.loc.end.line
      }
    })
  const targets = new Set(comments.map(comment =&gt; comment.end + 1))
  const nodes = []
  findFollowing(ast, targets, nodes)
  console.log(nodes.map(node =&gt; condense(node)))
}
</code></pre>
<p>The recursive search is straightforward as well---we delete line numbers from the target set
and add nodes to the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Accumulator pattern;design pattern!Accumulator" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#accumulator" markdown="1">accumulator</a></span> as we find matches:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const findFollowing = (node, targets, accum) =&gt; {
  if ((!node) || (typeof node !== 'object') || (!('type' in node))) {
    return
  }

  if (targets.has(node.loc.start.line)) {
    accum.push(node)
    targets.delete(node.loc.start.line)
  }

  for (const key in node) {
    if (Array.isArray(node[key])) {
      node[key].forEach(child =&gt; findFollowing(child, targets, accum))
    } else if (typeof node[key] === 'object') {
      findFollowing(node[key], targets, accum)
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally,
we use a function called <code>condense</code> to get the name we want out of the AST we have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const condense = (node) =&gt; {
  const result = {
    type: node.type,
    start: node.loc.start.line
  }
  switch (node.type) {
    case 'VariableDeclaration':
      result.name = node.declarations[0].id.name
      break
    case 'FunctionDeclaration':
      result.name = node.id.name
      break
    case 'ClassDeclaration':
      result.name = node.id.name
      break
    case 'MethodDefinition':
      result.name = node.key.name
      break
    default:
      assert.fail(`Unknown node type ${node.type}`)
      break
  }
  return result
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">We need this because we get a different structure with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const name = function() =&gt; {
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">than we get with:
{: .break-before}</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function name() {
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run this on our test case we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">[
  { type: 'VariableDeclaration', start: 8, name: 'double' },
  { type: 'FunctionDeclaration', start: 13, name: 'triple' },
  { type: 'ClassDeclaration', start: 20, name: 'Example' },
  { type: 'MethodDefinition', start: 24, name: 'someMethod' }

<h3>Code is data</h3>
<p>We haven't made this point explicitly in a while,
so we will repeat it here:
<span class="indexentry" index-key="code!as data" markdown="1">code is just another kind of data</span>,
and we can process it just like we would process any other data.
Parsing code to produce an AST is no different from parsing HTML to produce DOM;
in both cases we are simply transforming a textual representation that's easy for people to author
into a data structure that's easy for a program to manipulate.
Pulling things out of that data to create a report
is no different from pulling numbers out of a hospital database to report monthly vaccination rates.</p>
<p>Treating code as data enables us to do routine programming tasks with a single command,
which in turn gives us more time to think about the tasks that we can't (yet) automate.
Doing this is the foundation of a tool-based approach to software engineering;
as the mathematician <span class="indexentry" index-key="Whitehead, Alfred North" markdown="1">Alfred North Whitehead</span> once wrote,
"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them."</p>

<p><span class="indexentry" index-key="JavaScript!hurried design of" markdown="1">JavaScript</span> was designed in a hurry 25 years ago to make web pages interactive.
Nobody realized it would become one of the most popular programming languages in the world,
so it didn't include support for things that large programs need.
One of those things was a way to turn a set of easy-to-edit source files
into a single easy-to-load file
so that browsers could get what they needed with one request.</p>
<p>A <span class="indexentry" index-key="module bundler" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#module_bundler" markdown="1">module bundler</a></span>
finds all the files that an application depends on
and combines them into a single loadable file
(<a class="figref" href="../module-bundler/#module-bundler-bundling">Figure 17.1</a>).
This file is much more efficient to load:
it's the same number of bytes but just one network request.
(See <a class="tblref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming-times">Table 2.1</a> for a reminder of why this is important.)
Bundling files also tests that dependencies actually resolve
so that the application has at least a chance of being able to run.</p>

<img alt="Bundling modules" src="./module-bundler/figures/bundling.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 17.1: Combining multiple modules into one.</figcaption>

<p>Bundling requires an <span class="indexentry" index-key="entry point (of module);module!entry point" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#entry_point" markdown="1">entry point</a></span>,
i.e.,
a place to start searching for dependencies.
Given that,
it finds all dependencies,
combines them into one file,
and ensures they can find each other correctly once loaded.
The sections below go through these steps one by one.</p>
<h2 id="module-bundler-tests">Section 17.1:  What will we use as test cases?</h2>
<p>The simplest test case is a single file that doesn't require anything else:
if this doesn't work,
nothing will.
Our test case and the expected output are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = () =&gt; {
  console.log('in main')
}

module.exports = main
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">in main
</code></pre>
<p>In our second test case,
<code>main.js</code> requires <code>other.js</code>,
which doesn't require anything.
The main file is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const other = require('./other')

const main = () =&gt; {
  console.log(other('main'))
}

module.exports = main
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and the required file is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const other = require('./other')

const main = () =&gt; {
  console.log(other('main'))
}

module.exports = main
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The output we expect is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-out">other called from main
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Why <code>require</code>?</h3>
<p>Our tests cases use the old-style <span class="indexentry" index-key="require vs. import;import vs. require" markdown="1"><code>require</code></span> function
and assign things that are to be visible outside the module to <code>module.exports</code>
rather than using <code>import</code> and <code>export</code>.
We tried writing the chapter using the latter,
but kept stumbling over whether we were talking about <code>import</code> in Node's module loader
or the <code>import</code> we were building.
This kind of confusion is common when building programming tools;
we hope that splitting terminology as we have will help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our third test case has multiple inclusions in multiple directories
and is shown in <a class="figref" href="../module-bundler/#module-bundler-complicated">Figure 17.2</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./main</code> requires all four of the files below.</li>
<li><code>./top-left</code> doesn't require anything.</li>
<li><code>./top-right</code> requires <code>top-left</code> and <code>bottom-right</code>.</li>
<li><code>./subdir/bottom-left</code> also requires <code>top-left</code> and <code>bottom-right</code>.</li>
<li><code>./subdir/bottom-right</code> doesn't require anything.</li>

<h3>An unsolvable problem</h3>
<p>The dependency finder shown above gives the right answer for reasonable JavaScript programs,
but not all JavaScript is reasonable.
Suppose creates an alias for <code>require</code> and uses that to load other files:</p>
<p><code>js
const req = require
const weWillMissThis = req('./other-file')</code></p>
<p>We could try to trace variable assignments to catch cases like these,
but someone could still fool us by writing this:</p>
<p><code>js
const clever = eval(`require`)
const weWillMissThisToo = clever('./other-file')</code></p>
<p><em>There is no general solution to this problem</em>
other than running the code to see what it does.
If you would like to understand why not,

we highly recommend <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Petzold2008">Petzold2008</a></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get all of the dependencies a bundle needs
we need to find the <span class="indexentry" index-key="transitive closure" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#transitive_closure" markdown="1">transitive closure</a></span> of the entry point's dependencies,
i.e.,
the requirements of the requirements and so on recursively.
Our algorithm for doing this uses two sets:
<code>pending</code>,
which contains the things we haven't looked at yet,
and <code>seen</code>,
which contains the things we have
(<a class="figref" href="../module-bundler/#module-bundler-transitive-closure">Figure 17.3</a>).
<code>pending</code> initially contains the entry point file and <code>seen</code> is initially empty.
We keep taking items from <code>pending</code> until it is empty.
If the current thing is already in <code>seen</code> we do nothing;
otherwise we get its dependencies and add them to either <code>seen</code> or <code>pending</code>.</p>

<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 17.3: Implementing transitive closure using two sets.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finding dependencies is complicated by the fact that we can load something under different names,
such as <code>./subdir/bottom-left</code> from <code>main</code> but <code>./bottom-left</code> from <code>./subdir/bottom-right</code>.
As with the module loader in <a class="crossref" href="#module-loader">Chapter 13</a>,
we use absolute paths as unique identifiers.
Our code is also complicated by the fact that JavaScript's <code>Set</code> class doesn't have an equivalent of <code>Array.pop</code>,
so we will actually maintain the "set" of pending items as a list.
The resulting code is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import path from 'path'

import getRequires from './get-requires.js'

const transitiveClosure = (entryPointPath) =&gt; {
  const pending = [path.resolve(entryPointPath)]
  const filenames = new Set()
  while (pending.length &gt; 0) {
    const candidate = path.resolve(pending.pop())
    if (filenames.has(candidate)) {
      continue
    }
    filenames.add(candidate)
    const candidateDir = path.dirname(candidate)
    getRequires(candidate)
      .map(raw =&gt; path.resolve(path.join(candidateDir, `${raw}.js`)))
      .filter(cooked =&gt; !filenames.has(cooked))
      .forEach(cooked =&gt; pending.push(cooked))
  }
  return [...filenames]
}

export default transitiveClosure
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">import transitiveClosure from './transitive-closure-only.js'

const result = transitiveClosure(process.argv[2])
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node test-transitive-closure-only.js full/main.js

  "/u/stjs/module-bundler/full/top-left.js",
  "/u/stjs/module-bundler/full/top-right.js"
]
</code></pre>
<p>This works,
but it isn't keeping track of the mapping from required names within files to absolute paths,
so when one of the files in our bundle tries to access something,
we might not know what it's after.
The fix is to modify transitive closure to construct and return a two-level structure.
The primary keys are the absolute paths to the files being required,
while sub-keys are the paths they refer to when loading things
(<a class="figref" href="../module-bundler/#module-bundler-structure">Figure 17.4</a>).</p>

<p class="continue">The real cost, though, is the extra complexity of the data structure:
it took a couple of tries to get it right,
and it will be harder for the next person to understand than the original.
Comprehension and maintenance would be a little easier
if we could draw diagrams directly in our source code,
but as long as we insist that our programs be stored in a punchcard-compatible format
(i.e., as lines of text),
that will remain a dream.</p>
<h2 id="module-bundler-combine">Section 17.3:  How can we safely combine several files into one?</h2>
<p>We now need to combine the files we have found into one
while keeping each in its own namespace.
We do this using the same method we used in <a class="crossref" href="#module-loader">Chapter 13</a>:
wrap the source code in an <span class="indexentry" index-key="immediately-invoked function expression" markdown="1">IIFE</span>,
giving that IIFE a <code>module</code> object to fill in
and an implementation of <code>require</code> to resolve dependencies <em>within the bundle</em>.
For example, suppose we have this file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const main = () =&gt; {
  console.log('in main')
}

module.exports = main
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The wrapped version will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const wrapper = (module, require) =&gt; { // eslint-disable-line
  const main = () =&gt; {
    console.log('in main')
  }

  module.exports = main
}
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">And we can test it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const wrapper = (module, require) =&gt; {
  const main = () =&gt; {
    console.log('in main')
  }

  module.exports = main
}

const _require = (name) =&gt; null
const temp = {}
wrapper(temp, _require)
temp.exports()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">in main
</code></pre>
<p>We need to do this for multiple files,
so we will put these IIFEs in a lookup table
that uses the files' absolute paths as its keys.
We will also wrap loading in a function
so that we don't accidentally step on anyone else's toys:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'

const HEAD = `const initialize = (creators) =&gt; {
`

const TAIL = `
}
`

const combineFiles = (allFilenames) =&gt; {
  const body = allFilenames
    .map(filename =&gt; {
      const key = path.resolve(filename)
      const source = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8')
      const func = `(module, require) =&gt; {${source}}`
      const entry = `creators.set('${key}',\n${func})`
      return `// ${key}\n${entry}\n`
    })
    .join('\n')
  const func = `${HEAD}\n${body}\n${TAIL}`
  return func
}

export default combineFiles
</code></pre>
<p>Breaking this down,
the code in <code>HEAD</code> creates a function of no arguments
while the code in <code>TAIL</code> returns the lookup table from that function.
In between,
<code>combineFiles</code> adds an entry to the lookup table for each file
(<a class="figref" href="../module-bundler/#module-bundler-head-tail">Figure 17.5</a>).</p>

<img alt="Assembling runnable code" src="./module-bundler/figures/head-tail.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 17.5: Assembling fragments and modules to create a bundle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can test that this works in our two-file case:</p>

console.log(combineFiles(process.argv.slice(2)))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">/* eslint-disable */

  return `other called from ${caller}`
}

module.exports = other

}

</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and then load the result and call <code>initialize</code>:</p>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="module-bundler-access">Section 17.4:  How can files access each other?</h2>
<p>The code we have built so far has not created our exports;
instead,
it has build a lookup table of functions that can create what we asked for.
More specifically we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a lookup table from absolute filenames
    to functions that create the exports for those modules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a lookup table from the importer's absolute filename
    to pairs storing the name of the required file as it was written
    and the required file's absolute filename;
    and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an entry point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To turn this into what we want,
we must look up the function associated with the entry point and run it,
giving it an empty module object and a <code>require</code> function that we will describe below,
then get the <code>exports</code> it has added to that module object.
Our replacement for <code>require</code> is only allowed to take one argument
(because that's all that JavaScript's <code>require</code> takes).
However,
it actually needs four things:
the argument to the user's <code>require</code> call,
the absolute path of the file making the call,
and the two lookup tables described above.
Those two tables can't be global variables because of possible name collisions:
no matter what we call them,
the user might have given a variable the same name.</p>
<p>As in <a class="crossref" href="#module-loader">Chapter 13</a> we solve this problem using closures.
The result is probably the most difficult code in this book to understand
because of its many levels of abstraction.
First, we write a function that takes the two tables as arguments
and returns a function that takes an absolute path identifying this module.
When that function is called,
it creates and returns a function that takes a local path inside a module and returns the exports.
Each of these wrapping layers remembers more information for us
(<a class="figref" href="../module-bundler/#module-bundler-returning-functions">Figure 17.6</a>),
but we won't pretend that it's easy to trace.</p>
<figure id="module-bundler-returning-functions">
<img alt="Functions returning functions returning functions" src="./module-bundler/figures/returning-functions.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 17.6: A function that returns functions that return functions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also need a third structure:
a cache for the modules we've already loaded.
Putting it all together we have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import fs from 'fs'

<p>This code is hard to read
because we have to distinguish what is being printed in the output versus what is being executed right now
and because of the levels of nesting needed to capture variables safely.

except the promises in <a class="crossref" href="#async-programming">Chapter 3</a>.

it is all <span class="indexentry" index-key="intrinsic complexity" markdown="1">intrinsic complexity</span>:
anything that does what <code>require</code> does is going to be equally convoluted.</p>

we'd capture the exports in a variable for later use.)

</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="package-manager">Chapter 18: Package Manager</h1>
<p>There is no point building software if you can't install it.
Inspired by the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Comprehensive TeX Archive Network" markdown="1">Comprehensive TeX Archive Network</span> <a href="https://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a>,
most languages now have an online archive from which developers can download packages.
Each package typically has a name and one or more version(s);
each version may have a list of dependencies,
and the package may specify a version or range of versions for each dependency.</p>
<p>Downloading files requires some web programming that is out of scope for this book,
while installing those files in the right places
uses the systems programming skills of <a class="crossref" href="#systems-programming">Chapter 2</a>.
The piece we are missing is a way to figure out exactly what versions of different packages to install
in order to create a consistent setup.
If packages A and B require different versions of C,
it might not be possible to use A and B together.
On the other hand,
if each one requires a range of versions of C and those ranges overlap,
we might be able to find a combination that works---at least,
until we try to install packages D and E.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> install every package's dependencies separately with it;
the disk space wouldn't be much of an obstacle,
but loading dozens of copies of the same package into the browser
would slow applications down.
This chapter therefore explores how to find a workable installation or prove that there isn't one.
It is based in part on <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/07/11/lets-dev-a-package-manager/">this tutorial</a> by <span class="indexentry" index-key="Nison, Maël" markdown="1"><a href="https://arcanis.github.io/">Maël Nison</a></span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Satisfiability</h3>
<p>What we are trying to do is find a version for each package
that makes the assertion "P is compatible with all its dependencies" true
for every package P.
The general-purpose tools for doing this are called <span class="indexentry" index-key="satisfiability;SAT solver" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#sat_solver" markdown="1">SAT solvers</a></span>
because they determine whether there is some assignment of values
that satisfies the claim (i.e., makes it true).
Finding a solution can be extremely hard in the general case,
so most SAT solvers use heuristics to try to reduce the work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="package-manager-semver">Section 18.1:  What is semantic versioning?</h2>
<p>Most software projects use <span class="indexentry" index-key="semantic versioning" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#semantic_versioning" markdown="1">semantic versioning</a></span> for software releases.
Each version number consists of three integers X.Y.Z,
where X is the major version,
Y is the minor version,
and Z is the <span class="indexentry" index-key="patch number;semantic versioning!patch number" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#patch" markdown="1">patch</a></span> number.
(The <a href="https://semver.org/">full specification</a> allows for more fields,
but we will ignore them in this tutorial.)</p>
<p>A package's authors increment its major version number
every time something changes in a way that makes the package incompatible with previous versions
For example,
if they add a required parameter to a function,
then code built for the old version will fail or behave unpredictably with the new one.
The minor version number is incremented when new functionality
is <span class="indexentry" index-key="backward compatibility" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#backward_compatible" markdown="1">backward-compatible</a></span>---i.e.,
it won't break any existing code---and the patch number is changed
for backward-compatible bug fixes that don't add any new features.</p>
<p>The notation for specifying a project's dependencies looks a lot like arithmetic:
<code>&gt;= 1.2.3</code> means "any version from 1.2.3 onward",
<code>&lt; 4</code> means "any version before 4.anything",
and <code>1.0 - 3.1</code> means "any version in the specified range (including patches)".
Note that version 2.1 is greater than version 1.99:
no matter how large a minor version number becomes,
it never spills over into the major version number
in the way that minutes add up to hours or months add up to years.</p>
<p>It isn't hard to write a few simple comparisons for semantic version identifiers,
but getting all the different cases right is almost as tricky as handling dates and times correctly,
so we will rely on the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver"><code>semver</code></a> module.
<code>semver.valid('1.2.3')</code> checks that <code>1.2.3</code> is a valid version identifier,
while <code>semver.satisfies('2.2', '1.0 - 3.1')</code> checks that its first argument
is compatible with the range specified in its second.</p>
<h2 id="package-manager-consistent">Section 18.2:  How can we find a consistent set of packages?</h2>
<p>Imagine that each package we need is represented as an axis on a multi-dimensional grid,
with its versions as the tick marks
(<a class="figref" href="../package-manager/#package-manager-allowable">Figure 18.1</a>).
Each point on the grid is a possible combination of package versions.
We can block out regions of this grid using the constraints on the package versions;
whatever points are left when we're done represent legal combinations.</p>

<p>For example,
suppose we have the set of requirements shown in <a class="tblref" href="../package-manager/#package-manager-example-dependencies">Table 18.1</a>.
There are 18 possible configurations
(2 for X × 3 for Y × 3 for Z)
but 16 are excluded by various incompatibilities.
Of the two remaining possibilities,
X/2 + Y/3 + Z/3 is strictly greater than X/2 + Y/2 + Z/2,
so we would probably choose the former
(<a class="tblref" href="../package-manager/#package-manager-example-result">Table 18.2</a>).
if we wound up with A/1 + B/2 versus A/2 + B/1,
we would need to add rules for resolving ties.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Reproducibility</h3>
<p>No matter what kind of software you build,
a given set of inputs should always produce the same output;
if they don't,
testing is much more difficult (or impossible) <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Taschuk2017">Taschuk2017</a></span>.
There may not be a strong reason to prefer one mutually-compatible set of packages over another,
but a package manager should still resolve the ambiguity the same way every time.
It may not be what everyone wants,
but at least they will be unhappy for the same reasons everywhere.
This is why <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> has both <code>package.json</code> and a <code>package-lock.json</code> files:
the former is written by the user and specifies what they <em>want</em>,
while the latter is created by the package manager and specifies exactly what they <em>got</em>.
If you want to reproduce someone else's setup for debugging purposes,
you should install what is described in the latter file.</p>

<p>To construct <a class="tblref" href="../package-manager/#package-manager-example-dependencies">Table 18.1</a>
we find the <span class="indexentry" index-key="transitive closure" markdown="1">transitive closure</span> of all packages plus all of their dependencies.
We then pick two packages and create a list of their valid pairs.
Choosing a third package,
we cross off pairs that can't be satisfied
to leave triples of legal combinations.
We repeat this until all packages are included in our table.</p>
<p>In the worst case this procedure will create
a <span class="indexentry" index-key="combinatorial explosion" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#combinatorial_explosion" markdown="1">combinatorial explosion</a></span> of possibilities.
Smart algorithms will try to add packages to the mix
in an order that minimize the number of new possibilities at each stage,
or create pairs and then combine them to create pairs of pairs and so on.
Our algorithm will be simpler (and therefore slower),
but illustrates the key idea.</p>
<h2 id="package-manager-constraints">Section 18.3:  How can we satisfy constraints?</h2>
<p>To avoid messing around with parsers,
our programs reads a JSON data structure describing the problem;
a real package manager would read the <span class="indexentry" index-key="manifest (of package);package manifest" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#manifest" markdown="1">manifests</a></span> of the packages in question
and construct a similar data structure.
We will stick to single-digit version numbers for readability,
and will use this as our first test case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "X": {
    "1": {
      "Y": ["1"]
    },
    "2": {
      "Y": ["2"]
    }
  },
  "Y": {
    "1": {},
    "2": {}
  }
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>If you ever design a data format,
please include a standard way for people to add comments,
because they will always want to.
YAML has this,
but JSON and CSV don't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To check if a combination of specific versions of packages is compatible with a manifest,
we add each package to our active list in turn and look for violations.
If there aren't any more packages to add and we haven't found a violation,
then what we have must be a legal configuration.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import configStr from './config-str.js'

const sweep = (manifest) =&gt; {
  const names = Object.keys(manifest)
  const result = []
  recurse(manifest, names, {}, result)
}

const recurse = (manifest, names, config, result) =&gt; {
  if (names.length === 0) {
    if (allows(manifest, config)) {
      result.push({ ...config })
    }
  } else {
    const next = names[0]
    const rest = names.slice(1)
    for (const version in manifest[next]) {
      config[next] = version
      recurse(manifest, rest, config, result)
    }
  }
}


export default sweep
</code></pre>
<p>The simplest way to find configurations is to sweep over all possibilities.
For debugging purposes,
our function prints possibilities as it goes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const allows = (manifest, config) =&gt; {
  for (const [leftN, leftV] of Object.entries(config)) {
    const requirements = manifest[leftN][leftV]
    for (const [rightN, rightVAll] of Object.entries(requirements)) {
      if (!rightVAll.includes(config[rightN])) {
        const title = configStr(config)
        const missing = config[rightN]
        console.log(`${title} @ ${leftN}/${leftV} ${rightN}/${missing}`)
        return false
      }
    }
  }
  console.log(configStr(config))
  return true
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we run this program on the two-package example shown earlier we get this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node driver.js ./sweep.js double-chained.json
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">{X:1 Y:1}
{X:1 Y:2} @ X/1 Y/2
{X:2 Y:1} @ X/2 Y/1
{X:2 Y:2}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run it on our triple-package example we get this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">node driver.js ./sweep.js triple.json
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">{X:1 Y:1 Z:1} @ Y/1 Z/1
{X:1 Y:1 Z:2} @ X/1 Z/2
{X:1 Y:1 Z:3} @ X/1 Z/3
{X:1 Y:2 Z:1} @ Y/2 Z/1
{X:1 Y:2 Z:2} @ X/1 Z/2
{X:1 Y:2 Z:3} @ X/1 Z/3
{X:1 Y:3 Z:1} @ X/1 Y/3
{X:1 Y:3 Z:2} @ X/1 Y/3
{X:1 Y:3 Z:3} @ X/1 Y/3
{X:2 Y:1 Z:1} @ X/2 Y/1
{X:2 Y:1 Z:2} @ X/2 Y/1
{X:2 Y:1 Z:3} @ X/2 Y/1
{X:2 Y:2 Z:1} @ Y/2 Z/1

<p>This works,
but it is doing a lot of unnecessary work.

it turns out that 9 of the 17 exclusions are redundant rediscovery of a previously-known problem

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>compatible</code> function checks to see if adding something will leave us with a consistent configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const compatible = (manifest, config) =&gt; {
  for (const [leftN, leftV] of Object.entries(config)) {

</code></pre>
<p>Checking as we go gets us from 18 complete solutions to 11.
One is workable
and two are incomplete---they represent 6 possible complete solutions that we didn't need to finish:</p>

{X:2 Y:2 Z:2}

<p>Another way to look at the work is the number of steps in the search.
The full search had 18×3 = 54 steps.
Pruning leaves us with (12×3) + (2×2) = 40 steps
so we have eliminated roughly 1/4 of the work.</p>
<p>What if we searched in the reverse order?</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import configStr from './config-str.js'

// [reverse]
const reverse = (manifest) =&gt; {
  const names = Object.keys(manifest)

  const result = []

<p>Now we have (8×3) + (5×2) = 34 steps,
i.e.,
we have eliminated roughly 1/3 of the work.
That may not seem like a big difference,
but if we go five levels deep at the same rate
it cuts the work in half.
There are lots of <a class="glossref" href="#heuristic" markdown="1">heuristics</a> for searching trees;

<h2 id="package-manager-exercises">Section 18.5:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">Comparing semantic versions</h3>
<p>Write a function that takes an array of semantic version specifiers
and sorts them in ascending order.
Remember that <code>2.1</code> is greater than <code>1.99</code>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Parsing semantic versions</h3>
<p>Using the techniques of <a class="crossref" href="#regex-parser">Chapter 8</a>,
write a parser for a subset of the <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning specification</a>.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Using scoring functions</h3>
<p>Many different combinations of package versions can be mutually compatible.
One way to decide which actual combination to install
is to create a <a class="glossref" href="#scoring_function" markdown="1">scoring function</a>
that measures how good or bad a particular combination is.
For example,
a function could measure the "distance" between two versions as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const score (X, Y) =&gt; {
  if (X.major !== Y.major) {
    return 100 * abs(X.major - Y.major)
  } else if (X.minor !== Y.minor) {
    return 10 * abs(X.minor - Y.minor)
  } else {
    return abs(X.patch - Y.patch)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Implement a working version of this function
    and use it to measure the total distance between
    the set of packages found by the solver
    and the set containing the most recent version of each package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain why this doesn't actually solve the original problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Using full semantic versions</h3>
<p>Modify the constraint solver to use full semantic versions instead of single digits.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Regular releases</h3>
<p>Some packages release new versions on a regular cycle,
e.g.,
Version 2021.1 is released on March 1 of 2021,
Version 2021.2 is released on September 1 of that year,
version 2022.1 is released on March 1 of the following year,
and so on.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does this make package management easier?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does it make it more difficult?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Writing unit tests</h3>
<p>Write unit tests for the constraint solver using Mocha.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Generating test fixtures</h3>
<p>Write a function that creates fixtures for testing the constraint solver:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Its first argument is an object whose keys are (fake) package names
    and whose values are integers indicating the number of versions of that package
    to include in the test set,
    such as <code>{'left': 3, 'middle': 2, 'right': 15}</code>.
    Its second argument is a <a class="glossref" href="#seed" markdown="1">seed</a> for random number generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It generates one valid configuration,
    such as <code>{'left': 2, 'middle': 2, 'right': 9}</code>.
    (This is to ensure that there is at least one installable set of packages.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It then generates random constraints between the packages.
    (These may or may not result in other installable combinations.)
    When this is done,
    it adds constraints so that the valid configuration from the previous step is included.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Searching least first</h3>
<p>Rewrite the constraint solver so that it searches packages
by looking at those with the fewest available versions first.
Does this reduce the amount of work done for the small examples in this chapter?
Does it reduce the amount of work done for larger examples?</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Using generators</h3>
<p>Rewrite the constraint solver to use generators.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Using exclusions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the constraint solver so that
    it uses a list of package exclusions instead of a list of package requirements,
    i.e.,
    its input tells it that version 1.2 of package Red
    can <em>not</em> work with versions 3.1 and 3.2 of package Green
    (which implies that Red 1.2 can work with any other versions of Green).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain why package managers aren't built this way.</p>

<p>Our <span class="indexentry" index-key="virtual machine" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#virtual_machine" markdown="1">virtual machine</a></span> has three parts,
which are shown in <a class="figref" href="../virtual-machine/#virtual-machine-architecture">Figure 19.1</a>
for a program made up of 110 instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An <span class="indexentry" index-key="instruction pointer" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#instruction_pointer" markdown="1">instruction pointer</a></span> (IP)
    that holds the memory address of the next instruction to execute.
    It is automatically initialized to point at address 0,
    which is where every program must start.
    This rule is part of the <span class="indexentry" index-key="Application Binary Interface" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#abi" markdown="1">Application Binary Interface</a></span> (ABI)
    for our virtual machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four <span class="indexentry" index-key="register (in computer)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#register" markdown="1">registers</a></span> named R0 to R3 that instructions can access directly.
    There are no memory-to-memory operations in our VM:
    everything  happens in or through registers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>256 <a class="glossref" href="#word_memory" markdown="1">words</a> of memory, each of which can store a single value.
    Both the program and its data live in this single block of memory;
    we chose the size 256 so that each address will fit in a single byte.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<figure id="virtual-machine-architecture">
<img alt="Virtual machine architecture" src="./virtual-machine/figures/architecture.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 19.1: Architecture of the virtual machine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The instructions for our VM are 3 bytes long.
The <span class="indexentry" index-key="op code;virtual machine!op code" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#op_code" markdown="1">op code</a></span> fits into one byte,
and each instruction may optionally include one or two single-byte operands.
Each operand is a register identifier,
a constant,
or an address
(which is just a constant that identifies a location in memory);
since constants have to fit in one byte,
the largest number we can represent directly is 256.
<a class="tblref" href="../virtual-machine/#virtual-machine-op-codes">Table 19.1</a> uses the letters <code>r</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>a</code>
to indicate instruction format,
where <code>r</code> indicates a register identifier,
<code>c</code> indicates a constant,
and <code>a</code> indicates an address.</p>

<p class="continue">While there isn't a name for this design pattern,
putting all the constants that define a system in one file
instead of scattering them across multiple files
makes them easier to find as well as ensuring consistency.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-machine-execute">Section 19.2:  How can we execute these instructions?</h2>
<p>As in previous chapters,
we will split a class that would normally be written in one piece into several parts for exposition.
We start by defining a class with an instruction pointer, some registers, and some memory
along with a prompt for output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

import {
  OP_MASK,
  OP_SHIFT,
  NUM_REG,
  RAM_LEN
} from './architecture.js'

const COLUMNS = 4
const DIGITS = 8

class VirtualMachineBase {
  constructor () {
    this.ip = 0
    this.reg = Array(NUM_REG)
    this.ram = Array(RAM_LEN)
    this.prompt = '&gt;&gt;'
  }

}

export default VirtualMachineBase
</code></pre>
<p>A program is just an array of numbers representing instructions.
To load one,
we copy those numbers into memory and reset the instruction pointer and registers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  initialize (program) {
    assert(program.length &lt;= this.ram.length,
      'Program is too long for memory')
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.ram.length; i += 1) {
      if (i &lt; program.length) {
        this.ram[i] = program[i]
      } else {
        this.ram[i] = 0
      }
    }
    this.ip = 0
    this.reg.fill(0)
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In order to handle the next instruction,
the VM gets the value in memory that the instruction pointer currently refers to
and moves the instruction pointer on by one address.
It then uses <span class="indexentry" index-key="bitwise operation" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#bitwise_operation" markdown="1">bitwise operations</a></span>
to extract the op code and operands from the instruction
(<a class="figref" href="../virtual-machine/#virtual-machine-unpacking">Figure 19.2</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  fetch () {
    assert((0 &lt;= this.ip) &amp;&amp; (this.ip &lt; RAM_LEN),
      `Program counter ${this.ip} out of range 0..${RAM_LEN}`)
    let instruction = this.ram[this.ip]
    this.ip += 1
    const op = instruction &amp; OP_MASK
    instruction &gt;&gt;= OP_SHIFT
    const arg0 = instruction &amp; OP_MASK
    instruction &gt;&gt;= OP_SHIFT
    const arg1 = instruction &amp; OP_MASK
    return [op, arg0, arg1]
  }
</code></pre>
<figure id="virtual-machine-unpacking">
<img alt="Unpacking instructions" src="./virtual-machine/figures/unpacking.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 19.2: Using bitwise operations to unpack instructions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote class="break-before">
<h3>Semi-realistic</h3>
<p>We always unpack two operands regardless of whether the instructions has them or not,
since this is what a hardware implementation would be.
We have also included assertions in our VM
to simulate the way that real hardware includes logic
to detect illegal instructions and out-of-bound memory addresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next step is to extend our base class with one that has a <code>run</code> method.
As its name suggests,
this runs the program by fetching instructions and executing them until told to stop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

import {
  OPS
} from './architecture.js'

import VirtualMachineBase from './vm-base.js'

class VirtualMachine extends VirtualMachineBase {
  run () {
    let running = true
    while (running) {
      const [op, arg0, arg1] = this.fetch()
      switch (op) {
        case OPS.hlt.code:
          running = false
          break

        case OPS.ldc.code:
          this.assertIsRegister(arg0, op)
          this.reg[arg0] = arg1
          break


        default:
          assert(false, `Unknown op ${op}`)
          break
      }
    }
  }

  assertIsRegister (reg) {
    assert((0 &lt;= reg) &amp;&amp; (reg &lt; this.reg.length),
      `Invalid register ${reg}`)
  }

  assertIsAddress (addr) {
    assert((0 &lt;= addr) &amp;&amp; (addr &lt; this.ram.length),
      `Invalid register ${addr}`)
  }
}

export default VirtualMachine
</code></pre>
<p>Some instructions are very similar to others,
so we will only look at three here.
The first stores the value of one register in the address held by another register:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">        case OPS.str.code:
          this.assertIsRegister(arg0, op)
          this.assertIsRegister(arg1, op)
          this.assertIsAddress(this.reg[arg1], op)
          this.ram[this.reg[arg1]] = this.reg[arg0]
          break
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">The first three lines check that the operation is legal;
the fourth one uses the value in one register as an address,
which is why it has nested array indexing.</p>
<p>Adding the value in one register to the value in another register is simpler:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">        case OPS.add.code:
          this.assertIsRegister(arg0, op)
          this.assertIsRegister(arg1, op)
          this.reg[arg0] += this.reg[arg1]
          break
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">as is jumping to a fixed address if the value in a register is zero:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">        case OPS.beq.code:
          this.assertIsRegister(arg0, op)
          this.assertIsAddress(arg1, op)
          if (this.reg[arg0] === 0) {
            this.ip = arg1
          }
          break
</code></pre>
<h2 id="virtual-machine-assembly">Section 19.3:  What do assembly programs look like?</h2>
<p>We could figure out numerical op codes by hand,
and in fact that's what <a href="http://eniacprogrammers.org/">the first programmers</a> did.
However,
it is much easier to use an <span class="indexentry" index-key="assembler" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#assembler" markdown="1">assembler</a></span>,
which is just a small compiler for a language that very closely represents actual machine instructions.</p>
<p>Each command in our assembly languages matches an instruction in the VM.
Here's an assembly language program to print the value stored in R1 and then halt:</p>
<pre><code class="language-as"># Print initial contents of R1.
prr R1
hlt
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Its numeric representation is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mx">00010a
000001
</code></pre>
<p>One thing the assembly language has that the instruction set doesn't
is <span class="indexentry" index-key="label (on address)" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#label_address" markdown="1">labels on addresses</a></span>.
The label <code>loop</code> doesn't take up any space;
instead,
it tells the assembler to give the address of the next instruction a name
so that we can refer to that address as <code>@loop</code> in jump instructions.
For example,
this program prints the numbers from 0 to 2
(<a class="figref" href="../virtual-machine/#virtual-machine-count-up">Figure 19.3</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-as"># Count up to 3.
# - R0: loop index.

    which takes three instructions.</li>
<li>If the program <em>doesn't</em> jump back, it halts.</li>

</figure>
<p>The implementation of the assembler mirrors the simplicity of assembly language.
The main method gets interesting lines,
finds the addresses of labels,
and turns each remaining line into an instruction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  assemble (lines) {
    lines = this.cleanLines(lines)
    const labels = this.findLabels(lines)
    const instructions = lines.filter(line =&gt; !this.isLabel(line))
    const compiled = instructions.map(instr =&gt; this.compile(instr, labels))
    const program = this.instructionsToText(compiled)
    return program
  }

  cleanLines (lines) {
    return lines
      .map(line =&gt; line.trim())
      .filter(line =&gt; line.length &gt; 0)
      .filter(line =&gt; !this.isComment(line))
  }

  isComment (line) {
    return line.startsWith('#')
  }
</code></pre>
<p>To find labels,
we go through the lines one by one
and either save the label <em>or</em> increment the current address
(because labels don't take up space):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  findLabels (lines) {
    const result = {}
    let index = 0
    lines.forEach(line =&gt; {
      if (this.isLabel(line)) {
        const label = line.slice(0, -1)
        assert(!(label in result),
          `Duplicate label ${label}`)
        result[label] = index
      } else {
        index += 1
      }
    })
    return result
  }

  isLabel (line) {
    return line.endsWith(':')
  }
</code></pre>
<p>To compile a single instruction we break the line into tokens,
look up the format for the operands,
and pack them into a single value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  compile (instruction, labels) {
    const [op, ...args] = instruction.split(/\s+/)
    assert(op in OPS,
      `Unknown operation "${op}"`)
    let result = 0
    switch (OPS[op].fmt) {
      case '--':
        result = this.combine(
          OPS[op].code
        )
        break
      case 'r-':
        result = this.combine(
          this.register(args[0]),
          OPS[op].code
        )
        break
      case 'rr':
        result = this.combine(
          this.register(args[1]),
          this.register(args[0]),
          OPS[op].code
        )
        break
      case 'rv':
        result = this.combine(
          this.value(args[1], labels),
          this.register(args[0]),
          OPS[op].code
        )
        break
      default:
        assert(false,
          `Unknown instruction format ${OPS[op].fmt}`)
    }
    return result
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Combining op codes and operands into a single value
is the reverse of the unpacking done by the virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  combine (...args) {
    assert(args.length &gt; 0,
      'Cannot combine no arguments')
    let result = 0
    for (const a of args) {
      result &lt;&lt;= OP_SHIFT
      result |= a
    }
    return result
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need few utility functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  instructionsToText (program) {
    return program.map(op =&gt; op.toString(16).padStart(OP_WIDTH, '0'))
  }

  register (token) {
    assert(token[0] === 'R',
      `Register "${token}" does not start with 'R'`)
    const r = parseInt(token.slice(1))
    assert((0 &lt;= r) &amp;&amp; (r &lt; NUM_REG),
      `Illegal register ${token}`)
    return r
  }

  value (token, labels) {
    if (token[0] !== '@') {
      return parseInt(token)
    }
    const labelName = token.slice(1)
    assert(labelName in labels,
      `Unknown label "${token}"`)
    return labels[labelName]
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try assembling a program and display its output,
the registers,
and the interesting contents of memory.
As a test,
this program counts up to three:</p>
<pre><code class="language-as"># Count up to 3.
# - R0: loop index.
# - R1: loop limit.
ldc R0 0
ldc R1 3
loop:
prr R0
ldc R2 1
add R0 R2
cpy R2 R1
sub R2 R0
bne R2 @loop
hlt
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">&gt;&gt; 0
&gt;&gt; 1
&gt;&gt; 2
R0 = 3
R1 = 3
R2 = 0
R3 = 0
0:   00000002  00030102  0000000a  00010202

8:   00000001  00000000  00000000  00000000
</code></pre>
<h2 id="virtual-machine-data">Section 19.4:  How can we store data?</h2>
<p>It is tedious to write interesting programs when each value needs a unique name.
We can do a lot more once we have collections like <span class="indexentry" index-key="array!implementation of" markdown="1">arrays</span>,
so let's add those to our assembler.
We don't have to make any changes to the virtual machine,
which doesn't care if we think of a bunch of numbers as individuals or elements of an array,
but we do need a way to create arrays and refer to them.</p>
<p>We will allocate storage for arrays at the end of the program
by using <code>.data</code> on a line of its own to mark the start of the data section
and then <code>label: number</code> to give a region a name and allocate some storage space
(<a class="figref" href="../virtual-machine/#virtual-machine-storage-allocation">Figure 19.5</a>).</p>
<figure id="virtual-machine-storage-allocation">
<img alt="Storage allocation" src="./virtual-machine/figures/storage-allocation.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 19.5: Allocating storage for arrays in the virtual machine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This enhancement only requires a few changes to the assembler.
First,
we need to split the lines into instructions and data allocations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  assemble (lines) {
    lines = this.cleanLines(lines)
    const [toCompile, toAllocate] = this.splitAllocations(lines)
    const labels = this.findLabels(lines)
    const instructions = toCompile.filter(line =&gt; !this.isLabel(line))
    const baseOfData = instructions.length
    this.addAllocations(baseOfData, labels, toAllocate)
    const compiled = instructions.map(instr =&gt; this.compile(instr, labels))
    const program = this.instructionsToText(compiled)
    return program
  }
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">  splitAllocations (lines) {
    const split = lines.indexOf(DIVIDER)
    if (split === -1) {
      return [lines, []]
    } else {
      return [lines.slice(0, split), lines.slice(split + 1)]
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Second,
we need to figure out where each allocation lies and create a label accordingly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  addAllocations (baseOfData, labels, toAllocate) {
    toAllocate.forEach(alloc =&gt; {
      const fields = alloc.split(':').map(a =&gt; a.trim())
      assert(fields.length === 2,
        `Invalid allocation directive "${alloc}"`)
      const [label, numWordsText] = fields
      assert(!(label in labels),
        `Duplicate label "${label}" in data allocation`)
      const numWords = parseInt(numWordsText)
      assert((baseOfData + numWords) &lt; RAM_LEN,
        `Allocation "${label}" requires too much memory`)
      labels[label] = baseOfData
      baseOfData += numWords
    })
  }
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it:
no other changes are needed to either compilation or execution.
To test it,
let's fill an array with the numbers from 0 to 3:</p>
<pre><code class="language-as"># Count up to 3.
# - R0: loop index.
# - R1: loop limit.
# - R2: array index.
# - R3: temporary.
ldc R0 0
ldc R1 3
ldc R2 @array
loop:
str R0 R2
ldc R3 1
add R0 R3
add R2 R3
cpy R3 R1
sub R3 R0
bne R3 @loop
hlt
.data
array: 10
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">R0 = 3
R1 = 3
R2 = 14
R3 = 0

<h2 id="virtual-machine-exercises">Section 19.5:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">Swapping values</h3>
<p>Write an assembly language program that swaps the values in R1 and R2
without affecting the values in other registers.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Reversing an array</h3>
<p>Write an assembly language program that starts with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the base address of an array in one word</li>
<li>the length of the array N in the next word</li>
<li>N values immediately thereafter</li>
</ul>
<p class="continue">and reverses the array in place.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Increment and decrement</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add instructions <code>inc</code> and <code>dec</code> that add one to the value of a register
    and subtract one from the value of a register respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewrite the examples to use these instructions.
    How much shorter do they make the programs?
    How much easier to read?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Using long addresses</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the virtual machine so that the <code>ldr</code> and <code>str</code> instructions
    contain 16-bit addresses rather than 8-bit addresses
    and increase the virtual machine's memory to 64K words to match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does this complicate instruction interpretation?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Operating on strings</h3>
<p>The C programming language stored character strings as non-zero bytes terminated by a byte containing zero.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a program that starts with the base address of a string in R1
    and finishes with the length of the string (not including the terminator) in the same register.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a program that starts with the base address of a string in R1
    and the base address of some other block of memory in R2
    and copies the string to that new location (including the terminator).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens in each case if the terminator is missing?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Call and return</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add another register to the virtual machine called SP (for "stack pointer")
    that is automatically initialized to the <em>last</em> address in memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an instruction <code>psh</code> (short for "push") that copies a value from a register
    to the address stored in SP and then subtracts one from SP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an instruction <code>pop</code> (short for "pop") that adds one to SP
    and then copies a value from that address into a register.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using these instructions,
    write a subroutine that evaluates <code>2x+1</code> for every value in an array.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise break-before">Disassembling instructions</h3>
<p>A <a class="glossref" href="#disassembler" markdown="1">disassembler</a> turns machine instructions into assembly code.
Write a disassembler for the instruction set used by our virtual machine.
(Since the labels for addresses are not stored in machine instructions,
disassemblers typically generate labels like <code>@L001</code> and <code>@L002</code>.)</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Linking multiple files</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify the assembler to handle <code>.include filename</code> directives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does your modified assembler do about duplicate label names?
    How does it prevent infinite includes
    (i.e., <code>A.as</code> includes <code>B.as</code> which includes <code>A.as</code> again)?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Providing system calls</h3>
<p>Modify the virtual machine so that developers can add "system calls" to it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On startup,
    the virtual machine loads an array of functions defined in a file called <code>syscalls.js</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>sys</code> instruction takes a one-byte constant argument.
    It looks up the corresponding function and calls it with the values of R0-R3 as parameters
    and places the result in R0.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="exercise">Unit testing</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write unit tests for the assembler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once they are working,
    write unit tests for the virtual machine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="debugger">Chapter 20: Debugger</h1>
<p>We have finally come to one of the topics that sparked this book:
how does a <span class="indexentry" index-key="debugger" markdown="1">debugger</span> work?
(The other was layout engines, discussed in <a class="crossref" href="#layout-engine">Chapter 11</a>.)
Debuggers are as much a part of good programmers' lives as version control
but are taught far less often
(in part, we believe, because it's harder to create homework questions for them).
In this chapter we will build a simple single-stepping debugger;
in doing so,
we will show one way to test interactive applications (<a class="crossref" href="#unit-test">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
<h2 id="debugger-start">Section 20.1:  What is our starting point?</h2>
<p>We would like to debug a higher-level language than the <span class="indexentry" index-key="assembly code" markdown="1">assembly code</span> of <a class="crossref" href="#virtual-machine">Chapter 19</a>,
but we don't want to have to write a parser
or wrestle with the <span class="indexentry" index-key="abstract syntax tree" markdown="1">ASTs</span> of <a class="crossref" href="#style-checker">Chapter 14</a>.
As a compromise,
we will represent programs as JSON data structures
whose element have the form <code>[command ...args]</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// const a = [-3, -5, -1, 0, -2, 1, 3, 1]
// const b = Array()
// let largest = a[0]
// let i = 0
// while (i &lt; length(a)) {
//   if (a[i] &gt; largest) {
//     b.push(a[i])
//   }
//   i += 1
// }
// i = 0
// while (i &lt; length(b)) {
//   console.log(b[i])
//   i += 1
// }

[
  ["defA", "a", ["data", -3, -5, -1, 0, -2, 1, 3, 1]],
  ["defA", "b", ["data"]],
  ["defV", "largest", ["getA", "a", ["num", 0]]],
  ["append", "b", ["getV", "largest"]],
  ["defV", "i", ["num", 0]],
  ["loop", ["lt", ["getV", "i"], ["len", "a"]],
    ["test", ["gt", ["getA", "a", ["getV", "i"]], ["getV", "largest"]],
      ["setV", "largest", ["getA", "a", ["getV", "i"]]],
      ["append", "b", ["getV", "largest"]]
    ],
    ["setV", "i", ["add", ["getV", "i"], ["num", 1]]]
  ],
  ["setV", "i", ["num", 0]],
  ["loop", ["lt", ["getV", "i"], ["len", "b"]],
    ["print", ["getA", "b", ["getV", "i"]]],
    ["setV", "i", ["add", ["getV", "i"], ["num", 1]]]
  ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Our <span class="indexentry" index-key="virtual machine" markdown="1">virtual machine</span> is structured like the one in <a class="crossref" href="#virtual-machine">Chapter 19</a>.
A real system would parse a program to create JSON,
then translate JSON into assembly code,
then assemble that to create machine instructions.
Again,
to keep things simple we will execute a program by
removing comments and blank lines
and then running commands by looking up the command name's and calling that method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

class VirtualMachineBase {
  constructor (program) {
    this.program = this.compile(program)
    this.prefix = '&gt;&gt;'
  }

  compile (lines) {
    const text = lines
      .map(line =&gt; line.trim())
      .filter(line =&gt; (line.length &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; !line.startsWith('//'))
      .join('\n')
    return JSON.parse(text)
  }

  run () {
    this.env = {}
    this.runAll(this.program)
  }

  runAll (commands) {
    commands.forEach(command =&gt; this.exec(command))
  }

  exec (command) {
    const [op, ...args] = command
    assert(op in this,
      `Unknown op "${op}"`)
    return this[op](args)
  }

}

export default VirtualMachineBase
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Remember, functions and methods are just another kind of data,
so if an object has a method called <code>"meth"</code>,
the expression <code>this["meth"]</code> looks it up
and <code>this["meth"](args)</code> calls it.
If <code>"meth"</code> is stored in a variable called <code>name</code>,
then <code>this[name](args)</code> will do exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>The method in our VM that defines a new variable with an initial value looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  defV (args) {
    this.checkOp('defV', 2, args)
    const [name, value] = args
    this.env[name] = this.exec(value)
  }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">while the one that adds two values looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  add (args) {
    this.checkOp('add', 2, args)
    const left = this.exec(args[0])
    const right = this.exec(args[1])
    return left + right
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Running a <code>while</code> loop is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  loop (args) {
    this.checkBody('loop', 1, args)
    const body = args.slice(1)
    while (this.exec(args[0])) {
      this.runAll(body)
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">and checking that a variable name refers to an array is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  checkArray (op, name) {
    this.checkName(op, name)
    const array = this.env[name]
    assert(Array.isArray(array),
      `Variable "${name}" used in "${op}" is not array`)
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The other operations are similar to these.</p>
<h2 id="debugger-tracing">Section 20.2:  How can we make a tracing debugger?</h2>
<p>The next thing we need in our debugger is
a <span class="indexentry" index-key="source map;debugger!source map" markdown="1"><a class="glossref" href="#source_map" markdown="1">source map</a></span> that keeps track of
where in the source file each instruction came from.
Since JSON is a subset of JavaScript,
we could get line numbers by parsing our programs with <span class="indexentry" index-key="Acorn" markdown="1"><a href="https://github.com/acornjs/acorn">Acorn</a></span>.
However,
we would then have to scrape the information we want for this example out of the AST.
Since this chapter is supposed to be about debugging,
not parsing,
we will instead cheat and add a line number to each interesting statement by hand
so that our program looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
  [1, "defA", "a", ["data", -3, -5, -1, 0, -2, 1, 3, 1]],
  [2, "defA", "b", ["data"]],
  [3, "defV", "largest", ["getA", "a", ["num", 0]]],
  [4, "append", "b", ["getV", "largest"]],
  [5, "defV", "i", ["num", 0]],
  [6, "loop", ["lt", ["getV", "i"], ["len", "a"]],
   [7, "test", ["gt", ["getA", "a", ["getV", "i"]], ["getV", "largest"]],
    [8, "setV", "largest", ["getA", "a", ["getV", "i"]]],
    [9, "append", "b", ["getV", "largest"]]
   ],
   [11, "setV", "i", ["add", ["getV", "i"], ["num", 1]]]
  ],
  [13, "setV", "i", ["num", 0]],
  [14, "loop", ["lt", ["getV", "i"], ["len", "b"]],
   [15, "print", ["getA", "b", ["getV", "i"]]],
   [16, "setV", "i", ["add", ["getV", "i"], ["num", 1]]]
  ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Building the source map from that is simple;
for now,
we just modify <code>exec</code> to ignore the line number:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

import VirtualMachineBase from './vm-base.js'

class VirtualMachineSourceMap extends VirtualMachineBase {
  compile (lines) {
    const original = super.compile(lines)
    this.sourceMap = {}
    const result = original.map(command =&gt; this.transform(command))
    return result
  }

  transform (node) {
    if (!Array.isArray(node)) {
      return node
    }
    if (Array.length === 0) {
      return []
    }
    const [first, ...rest] = node
    if (typeof first !== 'number') {
      return [first, null, ...rest.map(arg =&gt; this.transform(arg))]
    }
    const [op, ...args] = rest
    this.sourceMap[first] =
      [op, first, ...args.map(arg =&gt; this.transform(arg))]
    return this.sourceMap[first]
  }

  exec (command) {
    const [op, lineNum, ...args] = command
    assert(op in this,
      `Unknown op "${op}"`)
    return this[op](args)
  }
}

export default VirtualMachineSourceMap
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h3>It's not really cheating</h3>
<p>We said that adding line numbers by hand was cheating,
but it isn't.
What we're actually doing is deferring a problem until we're sure we need to solve it.
If our approach is clumsy or fails outright because of some aspect of design we didn't foresee,
there will have been no point handling line numbers the "right" way.
A good rule for <span class="indexentry" index-key="software design!deferring problems" markdown="1">software design</span>
is to tackle the thing you're least sure about first,
using temporary code in place of what you think you'll eventually need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next step is to modify the VM's <code>exec</code> method
so that it executes a callback function for each significant operation
(where "significant" means "we bothered to record its line number").
Since we're not sure what our debugger is going to need,
we give this callback the environment holding the current set of variables,
the line number,
and the operation being performed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

import VirtualMachineSourceMap from './vm-source-map.js'

class VirtualMachineCallback extends VirtualMachineSourceMap {
  constructor (program, dbg) {
    super(program)
    this.dbg = dbg
    this.dbg.setVM(this)
  }

  exec (command) {
    const [op, lineNum, ...args] = command
    this.dbg.handle(this.env, lineNum, op)
    assert(op in this,
      `Unknown op "${op}"`)
    return this[op](args, lineNum)
  }

  message (prefix, val) {
    this.dbg.message(`${prefix} ${val}`)
  }
}

export default VirtualMachineCallback
</code></pre>
<p>We also modify the VM's constructor to record the debugger and give it a reference to the virtual machine
(<a class="figref" href="../debugger/#debugger-initialization">Figure 20.1</a>).
We have to <span class="indexentry" index-key="mutual references" markdown="1">connect the two objects explicitly</span>
because each one needs a reference to the other,
but one of them has to be created first.
"A gets B then B tells A about itself" is a common pattern;
we will look at other ways to manage it in the exercises.</p>

<img alt="Initializing mutually-depending objects" src="./debugger/figures/initialization.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 20.1: Two-step initialization of mutually-dependent objects.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To run the program,
we create a debugger object and pass it to the VM's constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

import readSource from './read-source.js'

const main = () =&gt; {
  assert(process.argv.length === 5,
    'Usage: run-debugger.js ./vm ./debugger input|-')
  const VM = require(process.argv[2])
  const Debugger = require(process.argv[3])
  const inFile = process.argv[4]
  const lines = readSource(inFile)
  const dbg = new Debugger()
  const vm = new VM(lines, dbg)
  vm.run()
}

main()
</code></pre>
<p>A simple debugger just traces interesting statements as they run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import DebuggerBase from './debugger-base.js'

class DebuggerTrace extends DebuggerBase {
  handle (env, lineNum, op) {
    if (lineNum !== null) {
      console.log(`${lineNum} / ${op}: ${JSON.stringify(env)}`)
    }
  }
}

export default DebuggerTrace

<p>Let's try it on a program that adds the numbers in an array:</p>

// const total = 0
// let i = 0

<h2 id="debugger-interactive">Section 20.3:  How can we make the debugger interactive?</h2>
<p>What we have built so far is an always-on <code>print</code> statement.
To turn it into an interactive debugger,
we will use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync"><code>prompt-sync</code></a> module to manage user input
with the following set of commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>?</code> or <code>help</code> to list commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>clear #</code> to clear a <a class="glossref" href="#breakpoint" markdown="1">breakpoint</a> at a numbered line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>list</code> to list lines and breakpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>next</code> to go forward one line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>print name</code> to show a variable while at a breakpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>run</code> to run to the next breakpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>stop #</code> to break at a numbered line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>variables</code> to list all variable names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>exit</code> to exit immediately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the virtual machine calls the debugger,
the debugger first checks whether or not it is on a numbered line.
If it isn't,
it hands control back to the VM.
Otherwise,
its action depends on our current state.
If we are single-stepping or if this line is a breakpoint,
Otherwise, it does nothing.</p>
<p>The overall structure of the interactive debugger is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import prompt from 'prompt-sync'

<h3>Learning as we go</h3>
<p>We didn't originally put the input and output in methods that could be overridden,
but realized later we needed to do this to make the debugger testable.
Rather than coming back and rewriting this,
we have done it here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this structure in place,
the command handlers are pretty straightforward.
For example,
this method moves us to the next line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  next (env, lineNum, op, args) {
    this.singleStep = true
    return false
  }
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">while this one prints the value of a variable:</p>

    } else if (!(args[0] in env)) {

    return true

<p>After using this for a few moments,
though
we realized that we needed to change the signature of the <code>loop</code> method.
We want to stop the loop each time it runs,
and need to know where we are.
We didn't allow for this in the base class,
and we don't want to have to change every method,
so we take advantage of the fact that JavaScript ignores any extra arguments passed to a method:</p>

    this.checkBody('loop', 1, args)

    while (this.exec(args[0])) {
      this.dbg.handle(this.env, lineNum, 'loop')

<h2 id="debugger-test">Section 20.4:  How can we test an interactive application?</h2>
<p>How can we <span class="indexentry" index-key="unit test!interactive application" markdown="1">test</span> an interactive application like a debugger?
The answer is, "By making it non-interactive."
Like many tools over the past thirty years,
our approach is based on a program called <span class="indexentry" index-key="Expect" markdown="1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect">Expect</a></span>.
Our library replaces the input and output functions of the application being tested with callbacks,
then provides input when asked and checks output when it is given
(<a class="figref" href="../debugger/#debugger-test-interact">Figure 20.2</a>).</p>
<figure id="debugger-test-interact">
<img alt="Testing interactive application" src="./debugger/figures/test-interact.svg"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure 20.2: Replacing input and output to test interactive applications.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="continue">The results look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">describe('interactive debugger', () =&gt; {
  it('runs and prints', (done) =&gt; {
    setup('print-0.json')
      .get('[1 ?clnprsvx] ')
      .send('r')
      .get('&gt;&gt; 0')
      .run()
    done()
  })

  it('breaks and resumes', (done) =&gt; {
    setup('print-3.json')
      .get('[1 ?clnprsvx] ')
      .send('s 3')
      .get('[1 ?clnprsvx] ')
      .send('r')
      .get('&gt;&gt; 0')
      .get('&gt;&gt; 1')
      .get('[3 ?clnprsvx] ')
      .send('x')
      .run()
    done()
  })
})
</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>Expect</code> class may be short,
but it is hard to understand because it is so abstract:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import assert from 'assert'

class Expect {
  constructor (subject, start) {
    this.start = start
    this.steps = []
    subject.setTester(this)
  }

  send (text) {
    this.steps.push({ op: 'toSystem', arg: text })
    return this
  }

  get (text) {
    this.steps.push({ op: 'fromSystem', arg: text })
    return this
  }

  run () {
    this.start()
    assert.strictEqual(this.steps.length, 0,
      'Extra steps at end of test')
  }

  toSystem () {
    return this.next('toSystem')
  }

  fromSystem (actual) {
    const expected = this.next('fromSystem')
    assert.strictEqual(expected, actual,
      `Expected "${expected}" got "${actual}"`)
  }

  next (kind) {
    assert(this.steps.length &gt; 0,
      'Unexpected end of steps')
    assert.strictEqual(this.steps[0].op, kind,
      `Expected ${kind}, got "${this.steps[0].op}"`)
    const text = this.steps[0].arg
    this.steps = this.steps.slice(1)
    return text
  }
}

export default Expect
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Piece by piece:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>subject</code> is the thing being tested.</li>
<li><code>start</code> is a callback to start the system running.
    It gives control to the subject,
    which then calls back into the test framework for input and output.</li>
<li><code>get</code> and <code>send</code> store things to be given to the subject
    and to be checked against its output.
    Both methods return <code>this</code> so that we can chain calls together.</li>
<li><code>run</code> starts the system
    and checks that all expected interactions have been used up when testing is done.</li>
<li><code>toSystem</code> and <code>fromSystem</code> use <code>next</code> to get the next test record,
    check its type,
    and return the string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's modify the debugger to use the tester,
keeping in mind that the prompt counts as an output
(and yes, we forgot this in the first version):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import DebuggerInteractive from './debugger-interactive.js'

class DebuggerTest extends DebuggerInteractive {
  constructor () {
    super()
    this.tester = null
  }

  setTester (tester) {
    this.tester = tester
  }

  input (display) {
    this.tester.fromSystem(display)
    return this.tester.toSystem()
  }

  message (m) {
    this.tester.fromSystem(m)
  }
}

export default DebuggerTest
</code></pre>
<p>Again,
we can't pass the tester as a constructor parameter because of initialization order,
so we write a <code>setup</code> function to make sure everything is connected the right way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Expect from '../expect.js'
import VM from '../vm-interactive.js'
import Debugger from '../debugger-test.js'
import readSource from '../read-source.js'

const setup = (filename) =&gt; {
  const lines = readSource(path.join('debugger/test', filename))
  const dbg = new Debugger()
  const vm = new VM(lines, dbg)
  return new Expect(dbg, () =&gt; vm.run())
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try running our tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm run test -- -g 'interactive debugger'
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">
&gt; stjs@1.0.0 test /u/stjs
&gt; mocha */test/test-*.js "-g" "interactive debugger"



  interactive debugger
    ✓ runs and prints
</code></pre>
<p>That works---or does it?
Why is only one test shown,
and doesn't the summary appear?
After a bit of digging,
we realize that the debugger's <code>exit</code> command calls <code>process.exit</code> when the simulated program ends,
so the whole program including the VM, debugger, and test framework stops immediately
<em>before</em> the promises that contain the tests have run.</p>
<p>We could fix this by modifying the debugger callback
to return an indication of whether or not execution should continue,
then modify the VM to pay attention to that flag.
However,
this approach becomes very complicated when we have deeply-nested calls to <code>exec</code>,
which will happen with loops and conditionals.</p>
<p>A better alternative is to use an <span class="indexentry" index-key="exception!for control flow" markdown="1">exception for control flow</span>.
We can define our own kind of exception as an empty class:
it doesn't need any data
because we are only using it to get a typed object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class HaltException {
}

export default HaltException
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">Next,
we modify the debugger to throw this exception when asked to exit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import HaltException from './halt-exception.js'
import DebuggerTest from './debugger-test.js'

class DebuggerExit extends DebuggerTest {
  exit (env, lineNum, op, args) {
    throw new HaltException()
  }
}

export default DebuggerExit
</code></pre>
<p class="continue">And finally
we modify the VM to finish cleanly if this exception is thrown,
but re-throw any other kind of exception:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import HaltException from './halt-exception.js'
import VirtualMachineInteractive from './vm-interactive.js'

class VirtualMachineExit extends VirtualMachineInteractive {
  run () {
    this.env = {}
    try {
      this.runAll(this.program)
    } catch (exc) {
      if (exc instanceof HaltException) {
        return
      }
      throw exc
    }
  }
}

export default VirtualMachineExit
</code></pre>
<p>With these changes in place,
we are finally able to test our interactive debugger:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm run test -- -g 'exitable debugger'
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-out">
&gt; stjs@1.0.0 test /u/stjs
&gt; mocha */test/test-*.js "-g" "exitable debugger"



  exitable debugger
    ✓ runs and prints
    ✓ breaks and resumes

<h2 id="debugger-exercises">Section 20.5:  Exercises</h2>
<h3 class="exercise">Implementing tab completion</h3>
<p>Read the documentation for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync"><code>prompt-sync</code></a>
and then implement <a class="glossref" href="#tab_completion" markdown="1">tab completion</a>
for the debugger.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Modifying variables while running</h3>
<p>Add a <code>set</code> command that sets the value of a variable to a new value in a running program.
How do you handle setting array elements?</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Making output more readable</h3>
<p>Modify the tracing debugger so that
the statements inside loops and conditionals are indented for easier reading.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Better loops</h3>
<p>Our solution for handling loops is sloppy; fix it.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Using a flag to continue execution</h3>
<p>Modify the debugger and virtual machine to use a "continue executing" flag
rather than throwing an exception when execution should end.
Which approach is easier to understand?
Which will be easier to extend in future?</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Numbering lines</h3>
<p>Write a tool that takes a JSON program representation <em>without</em> statement numbers
and produces one that numbers all of the interesting statements for debugging purposes.
Use whatever definition of "interesting" you think would be most useful.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Looping around again</h3>
<p>Implement a "next loop iteration" command that runs the program
until it reaches the current point in the next iteration of the current loop.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Looking up objects</h3>
<p>Rather than having some objects call <code>setXYZ</code> methods in other objects,
it is common practice to use a lookup table for mutual dependencies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every object initializes calls <code>table.set(name, this)</code> in its constructor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever object A needs the instance of object B,
    it calls <code>table.lookup('B')</code>.
    It does <em>not</em> store the result in a member variable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Modify the virtual machine and debugger to use this pattern.</p>
<h3 class="exercise">Watching for variable changes</h3>
<p>Modify the debugger and virtual machine to implement <a class="glossref" href="#watchpoint" markdown="1">watchpoints</a>
that halt the program whenever the value of a variable changes.</p>
<h3 class="exercise break-before">Translating JSON to assembler</h3>
<p>Write a tool that translates the JSON program representation
into the assembly code of <a class="crossref" href="#virtual-machine">Chapter 19</a>.
To simplify things,
increase the number of registers so that
there is always storage for intermediate results
when doing arithmetic.</p>
</section><section class="new-chapter"><h1 id="conclusion">Chapter 21: Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have come a long way since we listed the contents of a directory in <a class="crossref" href="#systems-programming">Chapter 2</a>.
Saving files in version control,
making sure code meets style rules,
debugging it and bundling it (hopefully in that order)---programmers do these things every day,
and we hope that understanding how they work will help you do them better.</p>
<p>We also hope that your journey won't stop here.

</ul>
<h2>Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.</p>
<p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
gvwilson@third-bit.com.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.</p>
<p>All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.</p>
<h2>Enforcement Guidelines</h2>
<p>Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:</p>
<h3>1. Correction</h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.</p>
<h3>2. Warning</h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.</p>
<h3>3. Temporary Ban</h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.</p>
<h3>4. Permanent Ban</h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.</p>

<h2>Making Decisions</h2>
<p>This project uses <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/088610998600100206">Martha's Rules</a> <span class="citation"><a class="bibref" href="#Minahan1986">Minahan1986</a></span>
or consensus decision making:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an
    issue in the GitHub repository tagged "proposal".  Proposals must be filed
    at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that
    meeting, and must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue)</li>
<li>the full text of the proposal</li>
<li>any required background information</li>
<li>pros and cons</li>
<li>possible alternatives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are
    present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.  The
    group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their
    delegate is present.  The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the
    item to the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the sponsor presents the proposal, a "sense" vote is cast for the
    proposal prior to any discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who likes the proposal?</li>
<li>Who can live with the proposal?</li>
<li>Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it passes
    immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is postponed for
    further rework by the sponsor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, members who are uncomfortable can briefly state their objections.
    A timer is then set for a brief discussion moderated by the facilitator.
    After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add (whichever comes
    first), the facilitator calls for a yes-or-no vote on the question: "Should
    we implement this decision over the stated objections?"  If a majority votes
    "yes" the proposal is implemented.  Otherwise, the proposal is returned to
    the sponsor for further work.</p>
