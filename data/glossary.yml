    def: >
      Refers to a quote by Phil Karlton: "There are only two hard problems in
      computer science—cache invalidation and naming things." Many variations
      add a third problem as a joke, such as [off-by-one

    term: type declaration
    def: >
      A statement in a program that a variable or value has a particular data

      JavaScript.

- key: unicode

    term: Unicode
    def: >
      A standard that defines numeric codes for many thousands of characters and
      symbols. Unicode does not define how those numbers are stored; that is

    term: virtual machine
    def: >
      A program that pretends to be a computer. This may seem a bit redundant,
      but VMs are quick to create and start up, and changes made inside the
      virtual machine are contained within that VM so we can install new
      [packages](#package) or run a completely different operating system
      without affecting the underlying computer.

      taken to each element of a data structure in turn. It is usually
      implemented by having a generator "visitor" that knows how to reach the
      structure's elements, which is given a function or method to call for each
      in turn, and that carries out the specific operation.

      A set of rules for defining [HTML](#html)-like tags and using them to
