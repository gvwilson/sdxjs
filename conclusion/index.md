We have come a long way since we listed the contents of a directory in <a section="systems-programming"/>.
Saving files in version control,
making sure code meets style rules,
debugging it and bundling it (hopefully in that order)---programmers do these things every day,
and we hope that understanding how they work will help you do them better.

We also hope that your journey won't stop here.
If you would like to add a chapter to this book
or translate it into another programming language,
human language,
or both,
your help would be very welcome:
please see the introduction in <a section="introduction"/>
and the contributors' guide in <a section="contributing"/> for more information.
