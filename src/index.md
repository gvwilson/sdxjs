The best way to learn design is to study examples [% b Schon1984 Petre2016 %],
and some of the best examples of software design come from
the tools programmers use in their own work.
In these lessons we build small versions of things like file backup systems,
testing frameworks,
regular expression matchers,
and browser layout engines
both to demystify them
and to give some insights into how experienced programmers think.
We draw inspiration from [% b Brown2011 Brown2012 Brown2016 %],
[Mary Rose Cook][cook-mary-rose]'s [Gitlet][gitlet],
and the books that introduced the Unix philosophy to an entire generation of programmers
[% b Kernighan1979 Kernighan1981 Kernighan1983 Kernighan1988 %].
