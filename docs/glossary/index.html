<p><span class="glosskey" id="design_by_contract">design by contract</span>: A style of designing software in which functions specify the <a href="#pre_condition">pre-conditions</a> that must be true in order for them to run and the <a href="#post_condition">post-conditions</a> they guarantee will be true when they return. A function can then be replaced by one with weaker pre-conditions (i.e., it accepts a wider set of input) and/or stronger post-conditions (i.e., it produces a smaller range of output) without breaking anything else. See also <a href="#liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>.</p>
